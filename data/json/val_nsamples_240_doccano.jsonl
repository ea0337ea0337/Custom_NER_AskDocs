When I breathe, it stings. When I swallow, it stings. It also has this taste I cant describe. I just know it stings and occasionally makes my eyes water. It feels like it drips from somewhere behind my nose but I dont know exactly where. Id drink water whenever it happens to alleviate the discomfort, but most of the time it doesnt work. It just stings and its irritating. What could it be?", "label": [[401, 407, "SYMPTOM"], [428, 434, "SYMPTOM"], [455, 461, "SYMPTOM"], [518, 524, "SYMPTOM"], [756, 762, "SYMPTOM"]]}

Is that elevated SHBG is something to be concerned about regardless of its connection (or lack thereof) to my hair loss?\n2.

The pressure and pain is mainly behind my ears, on the sides of head, and in upper neck\n  Last night, for about 30 minutes, I has a scintillating scotoma in the middle of my field of vision. It eventually migrated leftward and then disappeared. The only time I have ever had this symptom before was about a year ago after golfing (which is a sport I regularly play when not pregnant). \n  Immediately following the scotoma, I had left sided numbness and tingling in my tongue, hand, and foot.\n  This morning, I still have the head pressure. But, as usual it only hurts when I cough. \n  Baby has been kicking away and quite lively as usual, even amidst last night's scary episode\n    Existing medical issues     \n  I have a decades long history of migraines, but never with aura. I also have not had a single migraine since becoming pregnant. \n  Not sure this is a \"medical issue\" per se, but my husband is Asian, which I have been told puts me at a greater risk of gestational diabetes. I have, however, had my blood sugars measured semi regularly at my prenatal appointments and everything has been fine (blood sugar always 70's 80s)\n  I have medical anxiety and possible hypochondria. This is something I have been trying to overcome for a very long time. It is due to the fact that my mother is a   with diagnosed Munchausen Syndrome and various other mental illnesses that slowly took over her life and ability to practice. As a result, as I was growing up, she slowly turned from a reputable   into someone who had all of us in the family fearing daily that she (and the rest of us) were dying from multiple ailments and that we could not trust other doctors to \"spot\" these signs of us dying. This is also one reason I would like to remain as level headed as possible about what's going on currently.

My blood pressure is normal   107 68. I also have normal blood pressure and no protein in urine at all of my prenatal appointments, which are done every 2 weeks here    \n  This probably doesn't mean much, but just in case   throughout my first trimester, I had rolling balls of light appearing in the periphery of my vision multiple times a day. This was not scotoma.

Symptoms \nDifficulty concentrating\nNot feeling as sharp as I used to mentally\nOccasional Low grade headaches\nMinor speech difficulties. Nothing impairing activities of daily living but Ive noticed having a hard time remembering words, stumbling more over speech, that sort of thing\nLoss of motivation\nDifficulty sleeping through the night (depression?)\nIncident prior to when I consider it starting \nI had a night of very heavy drinking (not sure how much, probably would say at least 15 standard drinks) and I did a bunch of what somebody told me was ecstasy. This was my first time doing ecstasy so I dont really have a standard of comparison, but I probably did a lot relative to my tolerance. Also not entirely sure if it was ecstasy, may have been some sort of amphetamine or similar \nPossible cause 1 \nI had a binge drinking problem for a few months prior to this incident. Probably would drink to excess a couple times a week. It was intermittent but I did experience alcohol withdrawal symptoms a couple of times prior to this incident (and after it). Never had alcohol poisoning, and heavy drinking had not been ongoing for years or anything, but I definitely had a problem. I have really tapered back drinking since this incident (stopped drinking cold turkey for a month and now only have a couple drinks 1 or 2 times a week at most). I had pretty serious (at least to me) withdrawal symptoms after this (fever, shakes). So possibly issue is brain damage from alcohol use or ongoing withdrawal symptoms?\nPossible Cause 2 \nMinor stroke or brain damage from Ecstasy   whatever I thought was ecstasy. I felt really terrible the day after this. I had some difficulty speaking but thought at the time it was just a normal comedown from the drug (maybe this is the case?). I was able to function   phone it in at work (remote office work) the next day so I cant imagine I was absolutely non functional, but I felt pretty awful that day and for the next few days. I was more concerned when I continuing not feeling right after a week or so. Main counterpoint to it being a stroke is I never felt too terrible, and my understanding is symptoms are usually pretty severe. \nPossible Cause 3 \nNeurological symptoms of herpes infection. That February, I had what I thought at the time was pinkeye. This would recur in April and was diagnosed as Herpes Kerastisis. I was on Triflouridine for the initial infection (eye drops) and then got an intermittent prescription for Valacyclovir which I took when symptoms recurred. I currently am not on the medication though. I am aware that herpes can cause encephalitis, but my understanding is that this is generally very severe with obvious long term brain damage. Curious if it is possible to experience lesser but still noticeable neurological symptoms and if you think it would be a good idea to go on an ongoing Valacyclovir prescription or anything.\nPossible Cause 4 \nGeneric depression. Ive been isolated due to COVID. Obviously developing a drinking problem isnt exactly indicating my mental health is stellar. A lot of symptoms are consistent with depression (sleeping difficulties, inability to concentrate, generally not feeling all there). My main concern is I definitely feel that something is wrong and I have a hard time believing it is all mental.\nAnyways, curious to hear your thoughts (should I get a brain scan?), happy to answer any additional questions.

Ive been struggling with some assorted mental health issues the past few months (Anxiety, OCD, etc.) and was prescribed Zoloft Sertraline. It is not the first time Ive taken the medication. I took it between my 8th   sophomore years, before waning off of it. However, my issues came back full force, and I discussed getting a prescription with my pediatrician and later, a psychiatrist. \nIm currently taking around 75mg, and my psychiatrist wants me to go up to 100mg. Im not entirely comfortable with that, but its not what Im posting about. \nEssentially, I have issues with taking my medication on time. I couldnt tell you why. I know I need to take it, and I get headaches and nausea when I dont. I dont have a personal conflict with the dose Im currently on. However, I am not great with self regulation, so I tend to take it at inconsistent times (always in the same half of the day at least) or not at all. \nI was wondering what kinds of issues could occur if I continue to take my meds inconsistently   long term issues, etc.   or if anyone has any advice for taking it on time outside of alarms.

There is no room in my jaw for any of them and a scan last year revealed that at least three are coming in sideways.\n I'm taking ibuprofen around the clock to keep ahead of the fever and inflammation, but although it's done its job as a fever reducer, the inflammation is just getting worse. Opening my jaw beyond a fingertip is difficult as my jaw is stiff and opening it all the way sets off the teeth in waves of pain for a moment. I can only chew with about six teeth on my left side (great for weight loss, I guess lol) because chewing anywhere else hurts so much the food turns to ash in my mouth. Do ERs have emergency dentists? I've called everywhere within six hours of my home, been willing to pay whatever is needed (no dental insurance), and I'm getting a little desperate. \nMedically, what do you recommend? Do you have any recommendations for getting them out?

No drugs or prescription medications, regularly take a prenatal vitamin  and magnesium supplement. Breastfeeding a 7 month old. \nShortly after my 3rd baby was born in 2018, I began having very strange symptoms. I had a small, single black dot in the center of my vision that would come and go. Neither my eye   or family   could find a cause for it. My period began coming every 2 weeks. A full blown period, not spotting. So heavy I bled through maxi pads and onto the floor a couple of times. Constant cramping in between bleeding. I gained 20 pounds in less than a month with no change to my diet or lifestyle. Almost daily migraines, sometimes with visual auras, and light headedness. Mood swings and anxiety. And erythema nodosum all over my shins. I usually have erythema nodosum during the first trimester of my pregnancies, but this was the first time Id ever had them outside of pregnancy.\nI saw my family   who ordered blood work. It all came back normal, so she sent me to my OBGYN, who had no clue but put me on a 3 month trial of a low dose of hormonal birth control to see if that could correct my hormones. The birth control helped with the frequency of migraines, regulating my cycles, and most of the erythema nodosum. But I still struggled with anxiety, occasional migraines, and the black speck in my vision.\nIn March of 2020 I became pregnant with my 4th baby. All symptoms disappeared, including the erythema nodosum. This was my first pregnancy without them during the first trimester. I delivered my baby in December, and my cycle came back at 4 months pp.\nEverything seemed normal up until last week. My hair started shedding in crazy amounts and I had a migraine with a visual aura. Then I noticed the black speck starting to show up occasionally in my vision again and two spots of erythema nodosum in my right shin. On Tuesday, I was cramping a lot and started spotting, about 15 days into my cycle. Thursday and Friday I had migraines again. Last night it was so bad I thought I was going to vomit. And tonight I was thinking about what were doing tomorrow and started feeling an overwhelming sense of irrational anxiety about our plans.\n Its like a switch was flipped and all of the old symptoms started to come back again.

Around the fourth of July, she had a bad stomach bug.  After that, she developed hand, foot, and mouth disease.  When she started recovering from that, she got another stomach bug.  Now she has been diagnosed with RSV and has a horrible cough.\nShe's been in daycare for about two years now and this hasn't been an issue before.  They've been wearing masks constantly for about a year now and are still mandating them.  Nothing substantial has changed, so it's very concerning to me that she'd have four illnesses over the course of four weeks.  I'm starting to worry that there's some kind of environmental issue going on.  For example, our cats have had fleas for a few weeks now and we've nearly knocked them out, but there been really difficult to get rid of for some reason (this isn't our first rodeo, we've had cats forever.  It's taking longer than usual to get rid of them).  We've all been bitten by these wretched things and it has crossed my mind that maybe she could be affected by the fleas.  I know coxsackievirus and RSV (which were formally diagnosed) aren't flea borne illnesses, so I'm probably just being paranoid.

She just finished a round of prednisolone.  She has been on the antibiotics for four days  I think the   said the antibiotics are for a secondary infection, but my husband is not the best note taker so I'm not entirely sure why that was prescribed.\nShe obviously doesn't smoke or drink or do any kind of recreational drugs and we do our best to give her a balanced diet and plenty of water and exercise.\nI guess my question is, is it normal for a toddler to have this many illnesses right in a row?  Even though the daycare takes many precautions with sanitizing and masks and hand hygiene?  She hasn't been well for more than 24 48 hours at a time for a month.  Could there be an environmental factor or some kind of issue with her body in recovering from these illnesses?  Should I take her in and ask for more research on her issues or just wait it out?  Not to sound selfish, but we also have a vacation in a week and I'm worried she'll still be sick and have to stay behind.  This would absolutely destroy her as she's been looking forward to it for months.\nWhat can I do to help her recover and stop getting sick constantly?  She won't be returning to daycare this week and has only been in daycare for a few days this month anyway.\nAny advice is greatly appreciated.

I feel unable to make my problem ear clear or pop like when you change altitudes or swallow hard, but the other ear is still capable of that. And I've had odd clicking and popping from inside of the problem ear. \nMy ENT prescribed an antibiotic from this description which I've been on for 5 days and it hasn't helped at all. I have a otoscope at home due to my frequent ear troubles and when looked at by a layperson following the guide book that comes with it they confirmed the problem ear had a black substance in it that wasn't in the other one. I'm fairly certain from past experience with my ears and ENT treatment, the ears need examined under the large ent endoscope machine, cleared out of whatever is causing the fluid discharge either manually or by the suction machine, and then whatever treatment procedure for whatever the root cause is. I had a fungal issue in my ear last summer from swimming and this feels somewhat like that but just to an extreme extent, although I haven't been swimming at all this year.\nThe issue here is every single ENT in my area is booked solid until later this week. And I'm incredibly uncomfortable to downright in pain and concerned this could take more of my hearing if left to worsen. \nThe  's nurse said if it's urgent I can go to the ER, but didn't mention if they'd actually be able to help there. I called the ER and again they said they can't tell me if they can help or if they have the equipment until they see me. The issue is I live with an advanced stage cancer patient on active chemo and don't want to sit in the ER for hours during COVID if they're just going to look in my ear, see it's really messed up in there, maybe try a feeble attempt at irrigation (nothing's really able to get in right now, I've tried my old anti fungal drops on my ENT's advice), give me something for the pain in the meantime (the pain's affecting my quality of life but I can grit through it without medicine), and refer me to my ENT. \nMy question is would a suburban US ER have the ability to clean and suction out my ears, and potentially do any kind of procedure I might need like inserting tubes? Could an ER   do that? (And hopefully in a manner as minimally as painful as an ENT?) Or should I just wait it out until I can get to my properly equipped ENT Wednesday? \nBasically I don't want to potentially expose myself to a potentially dangerous area for COVID with Delta out there despite being vaccinated if the ER can't solve the problem. Obviously because of the risks of what I might bring home to my cancer patient relative. \nThe hospital is in suburban satellite hospital to the major healthcare system's downtown main hospitals. The have 400 beds, they're a level 2 or 3 trauma center, they were also called a tertiary care center in an article (IDK if that's different from trauma level), but they're large enough they have combined cancer center, and a professional building tower attached, to give you an idea of the size and perhaps capabilities they might have. \nSorry to ask such a weird question, I just can't seem to get a straight answer anywhere else IRL.

{"id": 10971, "data": "Would you recommend Covid vaccination to someone with a history of vaccine induced Miller Fisher Guillain Barre? I have been thinking whether or not I should get vaccinated. \nI received a flu shot when I was 18 years old. It was the only vaccine I had received since my childhood vaccinations. I had gotten it because I had read that the flu season was worse than normal that year. I had never gotten the flu as far as I knew before, but I didn't want it to mess up my first year in college. \nSix days following vaccination, I began developing Miller Fisher.  It began with a lazy eye and within a few days I couldn't walk. I had no symptoms of any other prior illness or infection, and none was told to me at the time of the diagnosis. \nIt was four days in neuro ICU then two days observation with daily plasmapheresis. When they determined it wasn't getting worse I was able to return to my hometown, where I had a month of physical therapy before being cleared to return to school. I had residual weakness but not enough to impede daily life for a few months, and recurrent neuropathic pain in my right leg that persisted for a few years but also not enough to impede daily life. I lost my reflexes in my elbows and knees but no other existing damage after so long. \nSix years after that episode, I was diagnosed with hidradenitis suppurtiva and prescribed a course of amoxicillin to deal with some of the active lumps. A few days after starting the amoxicillin, I developed Miller Fisher again. All the same symptoms, but since I recognized it immediately I could get treatment immediately. This time I did IVIG. Either because of the quicker treatment or the treatment being better or something else, I only needed a week treatment in a regular observation room. I didn't need physical therapy as my strength was a lot better than the first time, and it only took a couple weeks after leaving the hospital to get back to normal. I am not a   but I think I am just an individual susceptible to it that has these triggers.\nAfter the first time I got sick, my family became antivaxxers and started believing all the regular antivax stuff (like autism, thimerosal, etc, even though none of that applied to me). When covid vaccines were announced as available, I told my parents that I cannot visit them again unless they get it. Now it could have been my declaration,, or it could be since my mom works in healthcare administration and my dad regularly travels out of the country for work, but in any case they both ended up getting mRNAs (not sure which but I know they have gotten them) as soon as their demographics became eligible. So that concern has dissipated for me, at least. \nBecause of my history, all doctors I've seen have recommended against getting any vaccines or taking antibiotics, which I have always assumed as being a precaution unless something particularly dangerous comes about. I won't insist against a vaccine if it was an Ebola pandemic or turn down antibiotics if I had plague or something. \nI've had spells of consideration whether or not to get vaccinated since they announced trials. I am now in another spell thinking about it. I am actually visiting my parents right now, thinking that I had planned a trip at such a time that transmission rates would be controlled by vaccination in the general public. I have no concern for their safety anymore, but now it's my own. \nI am slightly elevated risk for being 30, as I have asthma and obese with a BMI of 32 (but I am down from 38 a couple years ago). I still mask, still distance, still work from home (with a doctors note saying I shouldn't return to an office unless it's 90  vaccinated), and still generally avoid being indoors around people I don't know. I have eaten indoors at a restaurant and visited a bar indoors if the published covid numbers show low transmission where I live, but I've also told my (fully vaccinated) friends that I may have to cancel plans on short notice if there is a concerning trend in case counts locally. \nThat said, I also want to get back to doing the normal things again. I mean I would love to never work in an office again, but I also want to be able to travel and visit around the world as I have family all over. And now that vaccines are widely available, it seems like the world has basically said you either get the vaccine or you are on your own. Covid will simply be endemic. And I know my risk is nonzero. I don't know if there is anything to suggest any sort of relation of a history of autoimmune disease and Covid outcomes.\nBut the fact that I have had GBS triggered twice by some of the rarest possible reactions to medicine is something that weighs on me. I don't want to get that again even though I know what to expect. The physical experience of weakening is awful.. just as well, I don't live in the same state as my family, and I feel like the stress of me developing it again might kill my mom. She already has stress related heart damage from other events and gets vaguely worried if I don't call her for a couple of days. She had a little freak out when I suggested I might volunteer during the clinical trials last year. \nSo how should I think about this?

No body provides actual instructions, just to consult with your  . But I am not going back to this woman because she will tell me that I shouldnt come off of this medication, we should just add in more because my problems arent under control.

{"id": 10999, "data": "crazy false positive for a hypochondriac One month ago I woke up with mild discomfort in my lower right abdomen. I was very frightened that I had appendicitis, but, after speaking with a   friend I know, I sort of calmed down and thought it might just be from anxiety or quitting smoking.\nEventually, it got worse. I was nauseous and my bowel movements seemed strange, almost more watery than usual  I also had intermittent diarrhea. I went to Urgent Care, where they pushed on my appendix and told me that it was very unlikely to be appendicitis. Then, I went to a   who calmed me down a lot. He assuaged my fear that I had liver problemsI have drank a lot over the last few yearsand ordered four blood tests and a urinalysis  an STD test, iron level, and a routine blood test. He doesn't order any imaging tests because he tells me my symptoms are too vague and there isn't anything wrong with me, that the pain will probably just go away.\nThree days later he calls and says everything is fine, that I shouldn't worry. I began to feel a little bit better and my bowel movements slowly returned to normal, completely, though I still had mild discomfort. Then, three days after that, I get the shock of my life  a nurse called me a told me I tested positive for hepatitis C antibodies. I was totally flabbergasted. I asked her how it was possible, considering I have never really engaged in the high risk activities associated with it  she responded by basically assuring me it was true. She set up an appointment to talk to a different   at the clinic about this. The next day I went and the   told me that it was final and true. \"You have been exposed,\" she said. She sent me for four more tests  hepatitis A antibody and viral load, and hepatitis C antibody (this was the second antibody test) and viral load.\nFor three days I was absolutely stricken with grief. I couldn't sleep or really eat. I was basically having a 72 hour panic attack. I was despondent. Finally, on Saturday the nurse called and said, \"Great news! You do not have hep C. The antibody and viral tests were both negative. We figured out what happened. You had been exposed to hepatitis A in the past,\" which caused the false positive (apparently the hep A antibody was positive, though the viral load was negative). I asked her how that would be possible, considering I received the vaccine, and she told me she was simply relaying what the   had told her, but that the vaccine might have caused it anyway.\nIn short, I am still reeling from the entire experience. I am freaking out that there is a serious problem with my body, maybe my liver, despite the assurances of the   and the fact that my liver function tests were normal.\nAlso, about a month and a half ago, I was roasting some chickpeas and after I ate them I realized that, somehow, a plastic thumbtack and stuck to the bottom of the roasting pan, and that half of it had melted in the oven, while the chickpeas were roasting. I shared the meal with three other people. The thumbtack was under the pan, so I don't think it could've gotten onto the food, and only very little of it had melted anyway.
