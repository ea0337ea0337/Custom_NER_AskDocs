Social drinker  maybe at maximum 4 5 a week but sometimes Ill go months not drinking anything. 20mg Dexedrine spansule AM and 40mg Fluoxetine PM   a multivitamin. No recent med changes or diet changes. No history of IBD that I know of, although I used to have IBS in high school but I honestly think it was just from stress.\nOn to the actual problem \nI have had stomach issues for probably about three months now  bloating, foul gas, and very sticky stool. I would pass small amounts maybe 6 7 times a day. I was ignoring it because Im in school (premed) and dont really have time or energy to deal with what I thought was just me not remembering to take a lactose pill when I had milk products. However I have within the last few weeks completely cut dairy out of my diet. There was no real change i got a little better, and then a little worse, and then a little better, etc etc. \nUntil the last few days where my gas has been RANK, theres a serious overproduction of mucus, my stools are stickier than ever, and today about 15 20  of it has just been black grainy specks like coffee grounds. Like I said, Im pre med so Im very aware of the implications, I just dont want to automatically assume the worst. All Ive eaten the last few days is rice, mixed vegetables (corn, green beans, carrots etc), bananas, chicken, coffee, and cereal, so I dont think its from diet. My multivitamin has iron but Ive been taking the same one for over a year and this hasnt happened before. No severe pain or anything, but I have aspergers and my ability to accurately gauge pain is not great  Ive broken bones before and not noticed. \nRight now Im feeling some minor cramping in my lower abdomen, like right below my belly button, and a strange swollen feeling in my back under my ribcage. I have tachycardia when I stand up too fast, Im sleepy, sweating, and cold, but its hard to tell if thats a result of my Dexedrine starting to wear off or a symptom of my stomach issues. My entire abdomen is moderately bloated, a little flushed, but not tender to the touch anywhere, but the part of my lower back that feels swollen is slightly tender. I dont look pale and my breathing rate is not any faster than normal. The black coffee ground stuff hasnt increased or decreased in amount in my stool over the last four hours  Ive been keeping an eye on it with the intention of going to the walk in or something if it gets any worse or if any other alarming symptoms present themselves.\nMy questions is just  should I suck it up and go to a   right now?

Anyway as Ive worked on my diet being better the episodes have gotten further between but still once a month or every other month I get the runs. With very bad cramping. I am more gassy on average as well in general and I often get cramps even with normal movements. Doc said without any ESR levels being raised or weight loss its unlikely any IBD and to be fair a friend I have with Crohns does second that in his experience.

I have trouble peeing but apparently no kidney stones. I get extreme mouth sores that cover almost the entire surface of my mouth and tongue. I get rashes on my legs, too. I have a goiter in my throw that makes it painful and impossible to talk (ENT has cleared me, too). I have no control over my emotions when I'm off of progesterone. I take a progesterone pill because we learned it helps with the amount of blood I'm hemorrhaging but its also the only thing that makes me feel sane.

Dermatology doesn't understand the hair loss, I had endocrinology today which belittled my complaints (despite admitting I had no hair and that my thyroid was large on my ultrasound). OBGYN Endocrinolgoy says its endocrine's problem (and I had two surgeries through them towards the beginning of this, back in 2016    my uterus was one giant ball and they had to remove the extra muscle mass and take it out). \nRheumatology found ankylosing spondylitis, which I agree with.

I'm not entirely sure when I first fractured my ankle because I have a really high pain tolerance and all my hobbies are bad for it (Muay Thai, Boxing, Pole Dancing with the 8 inch heels, and longboarding). I thought I'd sprained it a couple of times in the past but never got it looked at and would just keep working out as per usual when the pain would subside. I have a bunch of meds but they're mostly for mental health issues (e.g. antidepressants, anxiolytics, sleeping pills). Anyway, a week ago, I got drunk (I know. So stupid.) and thought I sprained it again after the fall. I couldn't get up so I was sent to the hospital because the EMT thought I tore a ligament. The MRI showed that I have a chronic avulsion fracture of the lateral malleolus with marrow oedema in the avulsed fragment indicating acute on chronic injury. ATFL nearly completely attached to this fragment shows grade II sprain. CFL has a grade II sprain. Superficial deltoid severe sprain versus low grade partial tear. No osteochondral lesion seen.

This included full abdomen (gullbladder, pancreas, spleen, etc.)  \n   Pulmonary Function Test  The results led doctors to think possibly asthma but I can hike and bike extensively without issue.  \n   Gastric Emptying Study  Normal results, emptied after 3 hours.  \n   Throat Motility Study   slightly below average, nothing alarming (that's what prompted Reglan, which only made me more anxious and nauseous).  \n   Impedance and Bravo PH studies. Came back normal, no signs of reflux. So, I reckon not GERD.  \nMedicines Taken   \n   Prilosec, Nexium, Tagamet, Pepcid. Peaked at Nexium 40 mg twice a day for about two months. No real change at all. Actually felt small amount of reflux after stopping Nexium (unique to the chest pain I typically feel).  \n   Nortriptyline   two separate month long stints. No change.  \n   Cyclobenzaprine   two stints for a month plus. No change.  \n   Reglan   no luck. Took with Pepcid for a few weeks. Made me anxious.  \n   Ibuprofen   took 800 mg three times a day, along with the Cyclobenzaprine and Pepcid with no luck.  \n   Nortriptyline (took for more than a month with no real help).  \nDoctors Seen   \n   I have seen three GI doctors, a PCP, a pulmonologist, an Internal Medicine, a Thoracic Team, and a Rheumatologist, along with some folks when I went to the ER back in June after feeling rather nauseous.  \nQuestions   \n1. Hernia didnt show up on these imaging tests. The more recent symptoms of pain in my belly depending on my posture is more recent.  \n2. Had been scheduled for a Chest and Abdomen MRI today but wasnt authorized by insurance. Would this be a better method to detect a Hernia?  \n3. Are there other obvious tests I have missed that would be worth pursuing to diagnose Hernia?  \n4. Should a specialist be able to physically examine me and determine this? Ive had various doctors feel all around my chest and belly without much success to date but I cant say they are hernia specialists.  \nTL DR  Chest Pain and Nausea for Months, had taken PPIs off and on (did 2 month straight of Nexium), endoscopy, chest x ray, blood work, echocardiogram, CT scans of Chest   Abdomen, Gastric Emptying Study, PFT normal, PH Studies, etc. all normal.

{"id": 10219, "data": "I Randomly Smell Terrible (20M) Let me just start off by saying that I do shower properly and regularly. Also, I talk about suicide here, so if that does you no good, please don't read. Lastly, I'm from the UK, if that matters.\nThis is an issue that has taken centre stage in my life for the last 5 or so years. I find that randomly, I start to smell. Sometimes like urine, other times like feces and sometimes it resembles the smell of a bin on a very hot day. After doing some research at like 16 years old I was overwhelmed by the stories of people who'd suffered something similar. There were only a handful of medical terms for diseases discussed by them, and I feel as if I fit into none of them. After being rocked with such confusion, and after feeling so damn helpless, I just told myself it was in my head and instead, I consciously distanced myself from everyone. Friends would randomly ask \"did you fart?\" and \"is there a bin around?\" when it flared up, but they didn't completely abandon me, even though I'm sure they realised I was the one smelling. Even as naive as I was and as emotionally underdeveloped I was at 16, I couldn't help but hate myself. In under a 5 month span, I went from a very happy kid with a very healthy social life to whatever beast I am now.\nSince then, it's only got worse. I was still telling myself it was in my head, though, as reality was just too scary for me. Now, I feel as though I smell terribly for the majority of the day. It's gotten to a point to where I can tell that my family don't want to be near me. Really, that, with the fact that I will be starting university soon, has made me realise that I must face this head on. After 6 years of losing connection and living like a zombie, I'm ready to hear of what I could be suffering from.\nThis problem has been the root of essentially all the problems I've faced since I was 15.  From the anxiety, to the suicidal ideation, to the depression and even how awkward I've become. Some nights I find myself wandering of what could've been had I not had this problem, and other nights I think of very violent ways to go out. It's something that I've never wanted to admit was even real, but there's no doubt in my mind that it is real now. What still scares me, though, is the prospect of having to live with this for a long time pushing me to do something stupid. I just can't picture myself living like this for much longer, and to be frank, I think that ending it all is one very plausible conclusion for me.\nSome things I've realised js that certain foods makes it flare up worse, and those foods are all either gassy or sugary. Still, though, it feels like no foods are fool proof. I'm not sure why, but I feel as if it's linked in one way or another to my IBS. \nIf you're finding it hard to follow my ramblings, I'm sorry. I'm not doing very well mentally right now and it seems like it's having an effect on my ability to write.\nNow, what I want to ask is if you guys know of anything I could be suffering from? If so, do you know of how I could get treatment? If not, how do I go about getting any form of help, especially during a pandemic? I feel as this is life or death for me, and I genuinely want to keep living.\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on anything or if you know of any alternative options beside the ones mentioned above. \nIf you've taken your time to read through all of this, I appreciate it.

{"id": 10221, "data": "Severe OCD. Terrible sleep. Lingering depressive symptoms. Anhedonia. 26, Male. White. There's a lot of information but I'm desperate. I'd very much appreciate any help.\n  Background Information  \nI think about 3 5 people from my past and conversations I had with them constantly all day every day  this has been going on for 4 years. Even in my sleep I think about these people and events involving them. I wake up feeling exhausted and suffering, like I'm sinking into death.\nI don't think I get enough oxygen when I sleep. I had a full sleep study done and there weren't enough waking events or whatever do diagnose sleep apnea. Everything else (I had every sensor possible  the study was done in the hospital) was normal. \nAs I wake up every morning, I feel horrible. I feel like I struggle to breath and sometimes I catch myself not breathing and have to use my willpower to get myself to breathe. \nAll my problems started the summer after I graduated high school in 2013. I was a successful swimmer, had plenty of friends, smart (got hired at Microsoft out of college but had to quit due to mental health). But the summer after HS I fell into a terrible depression  I didn't know what was happening at first, I thought I had Mono or nerve damage affecting my brain from getting dry sockets after getting my wisdom teeth taken out.\nI finally sought treatment my junior year  I told my parents that I was collapsing mentally. Got prescribed Lexapro and Ativan as needed. Lexapro saved my life and after 6 months most of the depression faded away. However, during the depression I began to develop OCD tendencies  cleaning the areas where my wisdom teeth were with Q Tips dipped in mouthwash then in water, three times or more a day. Became obsessed with grooming myself. Developed obsessive, intrusive thoughts about mildly traumatic past events that have become magnified. Most of the OCD behavior went away with the Lexapro as well, but these OCD PTSD intrusive thoughts have remained and utterly taken over my life.\nOne is of a time a teacher yelled loudly right in my ear in high school. I didn't think about it at all for 3 years then suddenly started thinking about it literally all day every day   maybe an hour per day max where it's not in my brain. The other thoughts involve people who hated me interacting with me at the funeral of a person I knew as an acquaintance in high school who killed himself. I replay interactions with these people, and one individual in particular who was very envious of me and unfortunately attended the same university as me.\nEven with Trazadone I get 5 hours a night max, and I don't feel rested at all. I exercise every day now  30 minutes of nonstop cardio (elliptical). I plan to increase it to 45min after   2 3 weeks. Currently taking Lexapro, Adderall, and Ativan. I know the last two may seem counteracting, but these three medications are the only ones that have ever helped me. And, I've tried almost every medication imaginable for my diagnosis  I'm not exaggerating. I have a big list my mother maintains.\n  Medications Tried  \nAnti psychotics  tried   5, couldn't tolerate  none helped and I had torturous akathisia with all but one, and lingering facial tics. \nAnti depressants  Lexapro, Cymbalta, Effexor, Luvox, Zoloft, Prozac, Paxil, Trintellix,  probably more. Lexapro still has been the most effective. Luvox was crazy   missed a dose and went into an inhuman rage, crying and calling my mother screaming. More  Wellbutrin, some SDNRIs or something (one that hit all three of dopamine, norepinephrine  \nBenzos  Klonopin, Lorazepam (Ativan), Xanax, Librium. Had a genetic test done  only significant thing was that I shouldn't take Valium so I never have. Also don't have that vitamin deficiency that makes medicines less effective (hopefully you know what I mean if you're a psychiatrist).\nHad TMS for OCD. Had 2 Ketamine treatments (6 sessions each) at two separate places, about 2 years apart. Had EMDR (did nothing).\nStimulants  Vyvanse, Mydais, Adderal XR, Adderall IR, Ritalin, Focalin. Adderall XR IR effective at giving my brain \"positive juice\" and executive function plus motivation. Feel like I've built up a tolerance but Adderall feels like it gives me life. The intrusive thoughts dial way down, motivation and positive mood go up, concentration goes up, feel much, much CALMER. Could at least be somewhat productive but still couldn't focus on work at Microsoft (work wasn't too technical for me... I just couldn't focus on getting done what needed to be done at the right pace. Spent time endlessly bookmarking internal company pages, lol. Still felt like a zombie being propped up by the stimulant. I'll get back to this.) I didn't tolerate Ritalin or Ritalin like meds at all  just made my mood sad and irritable.\nWhat else? Buspar, Lithium (made me feel dumb and confused), Phenibut.\nMarijuana  only made things worse so I don't smoke it at all. Never was a regular user  only occasionally and when I was so upset and frustrated I wanted to simply escape somehow. Depression started the day after I smoked weed at a party that summer after HS  I'm convinced Marijuana had something to do with the mental illnesss... I've always been very creative and high dopamine neurotransmitter amplitude (hyper hypo active troughout HS but I was very functional  just a little weird), so I think I was susceptible to weed induced psychotic illness. But yeah, Marijuana has only left me feeling worse for a few days after I use it.\nI don't drink or do any other recreational drugs.\n  Extra Misc. Information  \nHave terrible sleep  currently quitting Afrin since I got addicted whatever. Have bad airflow through my nose and my mother said I've been snoring and snoring more loudly than ever before.\nI'd been prescribed Trazodone to get to sleep which worked but still only 5 hours. Also, would struggle to breath when waking up... would catch myself not breathing, pretty terrifying. Now I only take a cocktail of benadryl with valerian root and some other supplements my mother has picked out. Trazodone dreams would be too intense sometimes when coupled with the stress of the intrusive thoughts.\nBlood test showed I had low Testosterone so I have a gel I rub on my shoulders now. Lexapro has really killed my libido and I can rarely achieve a full erection. I don't look like I'd have low testosterone  I'm 26, lots of chest and facial hair, physically attractive, 6'0\" and had an athletic build (I even weightlifted while depressed in college for a whole semester and achieved a muscular build) until I started gaining weight   6 months ago  was 210lbs a couple weeks ago which put me at overweight. In my swimming prime in HS I was 185 with lean muscles, six pack abs. Got weighed at an ENT appointment regarding my poor airflow through nose and was 198. Currently fasting dieting and continuing with cardio and I'm dropping weight quickly  I can feel the difference   the fat was mostly concentrated in my lovehandles, abdomen, and some in the face I think. A lot in the lovehandles and midsection.\nFeeling so frustrated. OCD for   4 years now. Was doing alright even with depression  got hired at Microsoft and loved my team, product. But, couldn't take care of myself  police had to come once and do a check since I lost my phone, so I didn't get reminded about picking up a prescription, so I stopped taking meds and descended into a mental haze and missed 3 days of work without contacting anyone. My apartment was a complete mess  everything strung out on the floor and tons of shit from home depot I purchased when hypomanic from Adderall. I bought  900 of crap because I wanted to DIY my apartment (?!)  thankfully my mom returned most of it after I called her and told her I was losing it and to fly out to rescue me. \nBy the way, when out in Seattle area I was taking 90mg Adderall IR a day plus 8mg Lorazepam a day (all prescribed  psych. wanted to push limits to see what would work)  I was basically high at work  I felt great but still wasn't productive and couldn't learn retain information due to all the Lorazepam, lol. I would forget things told to me the day before earlier in the morning. I would talk incessantly and butt into conversations   I was very uninhibited. It was like I was drunk but minus the impairment. Eventually I quit and moved back to my hometown in illinois to live with my parents. I quit in Jan. of 2020, so I've been living with my parents for over a year now. I was able to keep up programming a little every day in the beginning but now I have zero motivation to do anything. I can't pay attention to movies, books, anything. The thoughts are too strong. Sometimes I have explosive, rage like anger responses. My emotional state is disturbed. I feel trapped.\nThere's more information I can't recall right now. Anything at all would help  don't hesitate. I'm just frustrated and desperate at this point.", "label": [[4808, 4814, "DRUG"], [4816, 4823, "DRUG"], [3249, 3257, "DRUG"], [3298, 3308, "DRUG"], [7, 10, "DISEASE"], [424, 433, "SYMPTOM"], [1160, 1170, "DISEASE"], [1445, 1452, "DRUG"], [1457, 1463, "DRUG"], [1475, 1482, "DRUG"], [1528, 1538, "DISEASE"], [1571, 1581, "DISEASE"], [1601, 1604, "DISEASE"], [1890, 1893, "DISEASE"], [1922, 1929, "DRUG"], [1949, 1952, "DISEASE"], [1953, 1957, "DISEASE"], [2788, 2795, "DRUG"], [2811, 2817, "DRUG"], [3222, 3238, "DRUG"], [3240, 3247, "DRUG"], [3259, 3266, "DRUG"], [3275, 3281, "DRUG"], [3291, 3296, "DRUG"], [3326, 3333, "DRUG"], [3598, 3604, "DRUG"], [3868, 3871, "DISEASE"], [5048, 5058, "DISEASE"], [6254, 6261, "DRUG"], [6497, 6506, "SYMPTOM"], [7099, 7102, "DISEASE"], [7150, 7160, "DISEASE"], [1231, 1235, "DISEASE"], [3495, 3501, "DRUG"], [3552, 3566, "DRUG"], [3587, 3596, "DRUG"], [3607, 3612, "DRUG"], [3614, 3621, "DRUG"], [3998, 4005, "DRUG"], [4007, 4013, "DRUG"], [4027, 4038, "DRUG"], [4049, 4056, "DRUG"], [4858, 4866, "DRUG"], [5790, 5799, "DRUG"], [3268, 3273, "DRUG"], [3208, 3219, "SYMPTOM"], [3478, 3488, "DRUG"], [5985, 5993, "DRUG"], [6066, 6075, "DRUG"], [3283, 3289, "DRUG"], [59, 68, "DISEASE"], [2583, 2592, "DRUG"], [3166, 3175, "DISEASE"], [3369, 3374, "DRUG"], [1796, 1814, "SYMPTOM"], [3569, 3585, "DRUG"], [3697, 3703, "DRUG"], [4015, 4025, "DRUG"], [4040, 4047, "DRUG"], [2797, 2805, "DRUG"], [3879, 3887, "DRUG"], [4058, 4072, "DRUG"], [4723, 4730, "DRUG"], [4734, 4751, "DRUG"], [4199, 4207, "DRUG"], [5621, 5626, "DRUG"], [5999, 6012, "DRUG"]]}

I have no known health conditions. I have suffered from panic attacks most of my life, but mostly between ages 22 26, the last two years (possibly as a result of covid and other life stresses) it has manifested more as depression manic episodes high emotions and extreme overthinking.\nThe first episodes with my heart happened when I was 10 11 and they presented as a very fast heartbeat that made it heart to breath and also caused me to panic   they were brought on usually by exerting myself (e.g big bounce on a trampoline or bouncing onto my back and then my feet, or bending over after sprinting). These episodes were far and few between for most of my teenage years (maybe 4 5 times max over an 8 year period). \nThe most significant episode was when I was about 20 and I was at a music festival, I had just arrived and was ordering a hot dog, I had 3 bottles of beer and although was anxious about being at a big festival with crowds I remember feeling ok. Anyway, ordering a hot dog and my heart just went from rest to 200bpm. I rushed to the ambulances on site in a panic, ringing my parents and saying I was dying I love them and the paramedics measured my heartbeat at 174 by the time I got to them. \nIt eventually just calmed down and my parents came to collect me. By morning I was fine. I was referred to a   and they suspected it could be SVT. (I have never taken drugs and didn't heavily drink, I don't drink coffee or energy drinks). I do live in an almost constant state of anxiety and stress   I have a constant ball of pressure in my chest from anger, stress and anxiety. \nThe next most significant episode was familiar but happened when I was 24. I had a panic attack that seemed to never stop for hours and I drove to a hospital but was afraid to go in   It destroyed me. I lived the next two years in hell. Never leaving the house, never going anywhere unless I was within range of a hospital. Afraid to even bend over too fast. I lost 3 stone. I was in hell.\nI eventually came out of it and found myself a better man.

I am so stressed and fear the worst. \nI have had lots of ECGS, blood tests, x rays and ultrasounds of my heart to check and they were always clear. I've even been checked for hocum and cleared. My oxygen levels are always around 96 98 which worries me and made me throw away my oxometer because I don't smoke and couldn't figure out why it was so low. \nI'm sorry I've thrown alot at you but I am so desperate and I hope someone can please tell me what could be the problem.

My primary complaint is a reddish purple rash around my anus that has been there for approximately 6 months now. The skin also sometimes stings when water or sweat is present. It is also itchy sometimes, but not all the time. I have also noticed that after taking a shower or wiping, the skin appears more red and irritated. I will provide a link to a picture below. My only existing medical issues would be depression and anxiety which I have had for years and been treated with numerous anti depressants, but I am not currently on an any medication, except for Protopic 0.1  1 2 daily applied to the skin around the anus and a fiber supplement. I don't drink, smoke, or use drugs.\nI first noticed the rash in February, and it was very raw, red, and itchy and would crack and bleed. I first saw an online dermatologist for treatment soon after and was diagnosed as intertrigo. The dermatologist prescribed clotrimazole betamethasone to be applied twice a day to the skin around the anus for a month. This cream reduced the itching when applied, but did nothing for the redness which is my main concern. After a month with no results, the dermatologist instructed me to continue with the cream for another month. Again, after no results, he suggested I try zinc oxide (Desitin) for a month, which again reduced the itching and irritation when applied, but did nothing for the redness and the symptoms returned with no treatment applied.\nI then saw a different online dermatologist who diagnosed the issue as hemorrhoids. The dermatologist prescribed hydrocortisone 2.5 and fluconazole tablets. This did nothing for the rash, as I don't believe the issue was hemorrhoids.\nI saw another online dermatologist who diagnosed the rash as pruritus ani. He prescribed desonide 0.05 lotion to be applied twice a day for a month. He also recommended I used Balneol while wiping and Zeasorb on days I know I will sweat a lot. The rash and the itch still remain.\nI have now recently gone to a dermatologist's office and seen a PA C who also thinks the condition is pruritus ani. She prescribed Protopic 0.1  to be used 1 2 daily and recommended I used zinc oxide during the day. She also instructed me to stop using Balneol when wiping. I have been using these for about a week now with no results. I am feeling very defeated, as nothing I try seems to help.\nI would greatly appreciate any advice.

{"id": 10351, "data": "Medical Mystery after Moderna. Need Help ASAP please! 30F Posting on mobile, sorry ahead of time! \nBackground  30F 98lbs 53 Los Angeles. Diagnosed with Dysautonomia POTS OH by UCLA RR cardiac arrhythmia center in 2018. Was severe but became well managed with increased fluid and sodium intake and increased physical activity. All prescribed meds had severe side effects (bradycardia, extreme weakness, etc) so discontinued. Symptoms eased up over time with fluid and sodium therapy and I led a fairly normal life until March 2021. Im on birth control and I vape. (Bad habit I picked up, I know)\nI got my first dose of Moderna in late March at Dodgers Stadium. Within 10 15 min after the dose, I became severely weak all over. I struggled to breathe and it was if I had just been heavily sedated. I just slouched over and kind of melted into my seat, and couldnt lift my arms or neck in the car. We managed to get home, but my husband had to carry me into the house since I could not walk. Totally limp. I wrote it off as my POTS acting up or just having a sensitive body and just tried to sleep it off. While sleeping I had intense chest pains and felt as if I was going to vomit, but didnt. I couldnt walk due to extreme weakness for the next 4 days. \nI dont know if this is related, but somewhere around day 1 4 I developed a bizarre situation at the base of my skull. I cant remember much because its so hazy. It was a rough time.\nSo...I can not lay my head back or put pressure at the base of my skull. Basically any pressure at all on C1 C7 even down to T6 7 will cause me to black out, nearly pass out if I dont catch it in time, palpitations, tachycardia, intense pressure in my jugular veins, and dry heave with the most intense nausea Ive ever had. When I lay my head back for 20  seconds, I see stars and my right eye feels weird and my vision gets blurry around the edges. I have extreme lightheadedness, tremor like shakes and I can not eat more than a few bites at a time. I can not turn my head, tilt my head back, to the side or forward. I cant not lay back on a pillow or even tolerate laying on my side for more than a few minutes. I have to constantly let my head up and adjust to get the blood moving again. I literally wake up in the middle of the night dry heaving and I have to immediately adjust my position. \nSo, 22 of the 28 days in between the 1st and 2nd dose I slept on the bathroom floor due to sickness. Then I somehow convinced myself to get the second shot, and it got even worse. I slept on the bathroom floor for 27 days straight the second time until I figured out it was my neck and tried to make adjustments. I thought I was going crazy it took 3 months before I could muster up the strength to walk again.\nBasically long story short its been a total of 6 months of constant suffering and I didnt realize it until last week. Its all a blur. Prior to my Dysautonomia diagnosis, I was told by ER physicians that it was anxiety or heartburn or that it was all psychosomatic. I was told it was anxiety by 10  specialists before I happened to meet a random ER   that saved me after I collapsed in 2018. Basically everyone let me just suffer and never believed me and now I have a fear of doctors because I get dismissed. I know I need to work on this, and I shouldnt have let it get this bad before saying something. Im now in a wheel chair and Im just deviated at what has happened to me. I try with all my might to function and I force myself beyond what Im capable of and I suffer for it. \nI knew better than to go to the ER because I couldnt take someone telling me it was vaccine anxiety and it would kill me inside to ask for help when in desperate need and be turned away again. Im pro science and vaccine. I dont have anxiety in general either. I was even considering getting the booster but my husband and I agreed we need to get this sorted and see if theres a connection before I do so. Also, Im somehow still alive after 6 months so Im assuming its not life threatening. \nI contacted a neurologist who ordered an MRI w o contrast last week and she said nothing was wrong with me and it was all in my head. My PCP has no idea whats wrong and thinks its Thoracic Outlet Syndrome or Cervical Instability, but has no idea how to diagnose it and couldnt help me beyond that. \nI didnt have this neck issue prior to the covid vaccine. Or if I did, it was mild and not enough for me to notice and I may have confused it with Autonomic symptoms. \nIf anyone out there has any idea what this could be and offer me any advice I would appreciate it. \nMy symptoms make no sense and Im aware of that, but I was hoping someone out there might have something for me. \nIf I need to clarify anything please let me know and I can provide as much info as anyone needs. \nThank you Doctors of Reddit!", "label": [[4224, 4244, "DISEASE"], [1847, 1865, "SYMPTOM"], [152, 164, "DISEASE"], [371, 382, "DISEASE"], [184, 202, "DISEASE"], [165, 169, "DISEASE"], [537, 550, "DRUG"], [1024, 1028, "DISEASE"], [2274, 2285, "SYMPTOM"], [2954, 2961, "DISEASE"], [2965, 2974, "SYMPTOM"], [3027, 3034, "DISEASE"], [3617, 3624, "DISEASE"], [3758, 3765, "DISEASE"], [4357, 4370, "DRUG"], [1650, 1661, "DISEASE"], [384, 401, "SYMPTOM"], [4196, 4220, "DISEASE"], [1214, 1230, "SYMPTOM"], [1705, 1714, "SYMPTOM"], [2890, 2902, "DISEASE"], [1124, 1143, "SYMPTOM"], [1663, 1679, "SYMPTOM"], [1636, 1648, "SYMPTOM"], [1899, 1914, "SYMPTOM"], [1729, 1743, "SYMPTOM"], [1916, 1934, "SYMPTOM"], [618, 625, "DRUG"]]}

{"id": 10357, "data": "My blood CO2 is 19 mmol L. Dizzy and weak, thought it was just a bad time with POTS Hi, F22. I've had issues with POTS in the past and feel dizzy and horrible all the tim lately,, so I went to my   for a checkup. On the day of the checkup, I had a bad headache After the checkup, he prescribed me an NSAID for back pain that I wasnt able to pick up at the pharmacy, so I took an old naproxen (with food) from when I was in a car accident a year ago. That night I woke up from sleep with severe back and stomach pain   not normal for me. The same thing happened the next night   laying on my back was excruciating and would cause stomach pain, but over time it went away. Idk if any of this is related. I had a horrible headache both days since then. Today I went and got blood work done, and regrettably, I got the results back before my   had a chance to look at them.     \n    \nEverything is normal besides mild anemia, lipids, A1C, etc all good but my blood CO2 was 19 mmol L, when normal is 22 and on Wikipedia it defined metabolic acidosis as below 22 mmol L, and my sodium was a little low, like right at the edge of normal. I expected the sodium thing because I pee a lot and drink a lot because of POTS and it never feels like I've eaten enough salt to not feel dizzy. My fasting blood sugar was 68   A1C said average of 88.     \nBut the acidosis thing really scares me because last winter I had a kidney infection with 104 fever out of the blue with no UTI, so I'm scared something is wrong with my kidneys. Which honestly would be comforting if I knew the context and it wasn't deadly because I've heard of kidney syndromes as a different diagnosis for POTS and I went into hypovolemic shock from diarrhea about 4 years ago when I was anorexic which felt like a severe reaction,,,, it's just like my body can never hold enough sodium and blood volume. But I'm scared because I don't want  it to be an emergency.

So I scratched away. Then I believe 2 days after those hives began to spread, slowly at first, but then the next day it got far far worse, and kept developing throughout the day.

High platelet count which has been since 2011, low iron, and few other highs lows in CBC but she's not concerned about those. Focus is on iron and platelets. Talks with specialist, thinks platelets is because of low iron, advises to correct that. Not anemic and no iron deficiency anemia either. Put on birth control and iron supplements, to go back for testing in May. Down 32 lbs.\nBeginning of March 2021 through end of March 2021   Slowly start eating again, gain back 10 lbs which is where I have been at since. Random evening I start shaking uncontrollably with chills and sick to my stomach. Sent for covid test, negative. Start feeing decent again. At this point I have still been dealing with fatigue, dizziness, etc. the whole time.\n1 week into Apr 2021   I start itching but no visible rash. Eventually get it under control with aloe vera lotion. \n2 weeks ago   I wake up one day with bruising all over my limbs, chest and stomach.

I worry but because my CBC and WBC have been normal aside from platelets I know the chances are very very unlikely. Now I'm just in the curiosity stage. Questions at very end.\n  x200B \nLong version \nI became sick the week or so before Christmas 2020. No appetite, nausea, constipation and no BM for days, weakness, and headaches were my main symptoms. I probably ate about one whole meal combined over the course of 3 to 4 weeks. At first I thought the flu, wasn't getting better after the first week so I called my original  . He scheduled me for a Covid test and it came back negative, that itself took about a week to complete. So 2 weeks in to being sick I still feel the same, I've started to lose weight quickly so around the beginning of the new year I ask him if I could go in for some lab work. Diabetes and high blood pressure is extremely common in my family and my mother was concerned it may be one or both of those. I let him know that, he said no I just have a stomach virus and would be okay soon. Spoiler alert, I never got better. He sends me for another Covid test which again came back negative. This is around the end of January 2021 now. I've had enough of him, I find a new  . Beginning of February she looks over my record, I explain to her how I've been feeling and she orders multiple tests as it had been over 5 years since I last had a blood test of any kind. She ordered a CBC, WBC differential, thyroid, fasting lipid panel, iron, and more that I don't know exactly what they're for. By this time I've already lost around 20lbs. I finally start getting some answers but it's just raising more questions. My platelet count was in the 500s, and had been over the 450s since 2011. So they were steadily rising. My iron was also low. I had a couple other highs lows in my results but she has never focused on those. Her concern was platelets and iron. She consulted with a specialist who said the thrombocytosis was probably due to iron deficiency. She rules out both anemia and iron deficiency anemia. She has me meet with the OBGYN and I get put on birth control. She also advises I take some iron supplements and I'll go back for testing in around 3 months since it's now end of February and I've lost a total of around 32lbs. I slowly get an appetite back and start eating again, but I feel full fast. It's mid March, I've gained back 10lbs and it's the weight I've been maintaining since. I lose my appetite again, no BM. One evening I was feeling extremely bad, visibly shaking with chills and could not stop. Felt nauseas and sick again. (I have never once thrown up since getting sick but have come very close. I have emetophobia so that's a struggle in itself.) Call her the next day, I get sent for Covid test. Negative. The stomach symptoms fade again, I can eat but never a full meal anymore, I've maintained the 10lbs I gained back, so I feel okay. Note that this whole time I have also been very fatigued, dizzy, lightheaded, so many naps, occasional body aches but again I've been used to dealing with those and those symptoms get put on the back burner all the time. It's now beginning of April. No stomach symptoms, still fatigue, yada yada yada. Week into the month, I start itching. I feel like I have a rash but do not see one. I would occasionally itch until I bleed almost, I've cried because of the itching, ran into the shower mid day to try and soothe it. This is for maybe about a week or so. So now mid April, aloe vera lotion had the itching under control. Now to 2 weeks ago, I wake up with bruises. On my arms, legs, stomach, and chest. I have no injury because again, very tired and lots of naps. I start waking up every day with at least 2 to 3 new bruises. I'm due to be going back for my lab work check up anyways so I hold it out as long as I can. Finally the other day I called and made an appointment with her because of the bruising which has not gone away and is still happening. I had the appointment 2 days ago, go in for the scheduled lab work and she orders some new ones. She said she will get in touch with me when the results come back. Results back same day, iron has started to go up but is still low and my platelets are still high. Few of the other highs lows in my CBCs have gone into normal ranges. Same night of the appointment for the bruising, I get into the shower and have what looks like a rash (but no itching) clumped up in different areas of my body. I googled, thinking it was a rash, and it appears to be petechiae but of course I am not 100  sure. Next day, (yesterday, April 29) I chuck my symptoms into google (I know, I know) because after so many months of little to no answers I just wanted to see what was going on. Leukemia is popping up in every search result. After realizing googling was not a good idea, I start becoming worried and just deep dive into leukemia and other blood cancers disorders. I have symptoms of different types but besides my platelets, my CBC and WBC are totally normal. I know it would show pretty clearly if I did have leukemia or anything else. Anyways, my   said she would call when the results come back but she didn't, and it's now the weekend so I'm sure she'll call next week.\nNow for my multiple questions just going on in my head. (I understand you all are not my   and cannot properly diagnose me, I would just like input from other doctors to see what their suspicions are or where they would go from here.)\nWhy am I still sick? Good Lord, is it leukemia? Is that even possible with a normal CBC WBC? Could I actually be anemic and she just missed it? What other explanations could there be for why I have been continuously sick? Is there any reason for me to actually go get another  's opinion? Are all of my symptoms actually just stemming from anxiety? That's what bugs me the most. Every time I feel physically ill, my mother and doctors would just write it off as an anxiety. The answer has always been anxiety. My current   is the only one who has been listening to me and actually trying to help me.\nAgain, I know you are not my doctors and I don't expect a diagnosis from anybody but my real  . Curiosity has just gotten the better of me at this point after many months of being sick. I'm super sorry I've written a novel, I just word vomited everything.

My question is in regard to something from when I was 11. I was fairly tall and skinny for my age, but I want to clarify that I've never had any other medical issues, and I'm pretty healthy.\nSo when I turned 11 I had to get a biopsy after a routine MRI showed that there was a walnut sized lump in my brain, around the top right side. I was pretty young at the time, so I didn't understand what a tumor meant, much less how serious the situation was, so I only recall what my mom explained to me. Anyways, the results came in, and according to them, they had no clue what the lump was  according to my mom, they described it as a \"ball of mass\".  They observed me for some time to make sure I didn't have any seizures after, and eventually my seizures were less and less until I no longer needed check ups.\nMy question is, does anyone have any theories as to what this mass is?? It never got removed, so it's still there, and I never had any other severe seizures or anything like that, but I'm so curious to have some sort of answer.

Im a very hard stick and it always takes multiple tries and I get a blown vein probably half of the times I have blood drawn or have an IV. I have not reacted to contrast before. \nThe IV was in my right hand, and the nurse unsuccessfully tried my left arm and a second spot on my right hand before getting it in.

I have taken Benadryl in case of Mast Cell reaction, an NSAID for swelling, and applied heat and ice.

{"id": 10416, "data": "Can you damage your ear by pulling on it? \nI'll start off by saying that I knowthis is a very dumb situation. I (16F) am afraid that I damaged my ear by pulling on it.\nBasically, what happened was that my younger brother and I were messing around a couple of days ago, when suddenly, the toy that we were playing with clung onto his ear and I accidentally pulled on it. I felt so terrible, and I tend to overthink quite a lot, so I was extremely afraid that I just bent his ear into a different position or something permanently. When I looked at him, it looked like his ears were uneven, so I legit felt so guilty. I thought that I just ruined his ear. I literally stood there and apologized to him for ten minutes afterward, even though he literally told me that he felt totally fine.\nSo, feeling as guilty as I was, I decided that I wanted to do a test on myself and pull my own ears to see if it would bend my ear into a different position like I thought it did my brother's. I was feeling extremely emotional and impulsive at the moment, so I did. I pulled my ears with quite some force. I don't remember exactly how much though, cause the memory of it is rather hazy now as this happened about four days ago. All I can really say is that after I did it and pulled on my ears as hard as I could, I instantly regretted it. Making matters worse, the force with which I pulled my own ears was much stronger than how my brother's ear got pulled with his toy.\nMy left ear was the one I put more force into, and it hurt for a little bit afterward. I have already had problems with my left ear regarding it being extra sensitive to sound, but when I made the decision to pull on it, I completely forgot about that. For a while, my ear may have gotten better, but after having pulled on it, it seems that it is even more sensitive to sound now than it was before. It also just feels a bit strange. Maybe it's because I'm paying much more attention to it now than I had before.\nFurthermore, the day of and the day after it happened, I started feeling a pulsing sensation in my ear, as well as a twitching sensation. It seems to have gone away at this time though.\nAdditionally, today I decided to do an inspection of it by pressing down on it and holding it outward a little, and it made a cracking sound for some reason when I held it outward. It freaked me out so much that I did not try doing it again. As for pressing down on it with the palm of my hand, well, it made a cracking noise whereas my right ear did not. Even now, if I do it again, it keeps making that cracking noise. I don't want to do it anymore though because it makes me feel gross and scared. However, it might have done this prior to the event without me noticing since I had no reason to pay attention to it before.\nI told my parents about this, and they both told me that I don't have anything to worry about. They're quite sure of themselves that I could not have broken my ear. But even though they say that, I myself cannot be so sure. In fact, I'm rather worried. I'm scared that I broke or tore my ear cartilage, tore the blood vessels in my ear, or even damaged my hearing.\nI would like to think that if I did tear my cartilage, that there would have been some visible swelling or at least some pain. I have not felt any pain in my ear ever since the incident, even when I press on it or lay on it. With broken cartilage, I really would think that there would be a constant flow of pain or something like that. I doubt that my blood vessels tore because I would imagine that it would cause significant swelling. As for my hearing, well, I don't know much about that. Since what I pulled on was my outer ear, I would not think that it would damage my hearing as most of the parts of the ear that are essential to hearing are on the inside. I think that I can hear as usual, but what is bothersome is the extra sensitivity to sound. However, as I said, maybe it's just because I'm paying more attention to it right now.\nOverall, I'm most worried that I tore my cartilage. Specifically, the part that connects my outer ear to my head. I'm also worried that I damaged my hearing though.\nSome specific questions that I have are \n1. Can you tear your ear cartilage by pulling on your outer ear?\n2. If you were to break your ear cartilage, would it go unnoticed? Or would you feel lots of pain or see swelling?\n3. Can broken torn ear cartilage hear by itself?\n4. Can you damage your hearing by pulling on your outer ear?\n5. How likely is it that I tore my ear cartilage or damaged my hearing based on the context I provided in my post?\nI should be going to the   for a general some time in the coming month, but I dont even know how to bring this situation up to them given how ridiculous it is. Should I actually be worried and seriously talk to my   about this? Or should I follow my parents advice and just take a chill pill?\nI would be thankful for any advice. I would really appreciate if anyone could answer my questions or if anyone could give me any suggestions regarding my situation. I feel very nerve wracked about this, but I cannot talk to my parents about it anymore due to the fact that they find this situation so dumb (I dont blame them) that they dont want to hear about it anymore. I really regret that this even happened because if I did, in fact, damage my ear, I feel absolutely terrible since this is a situation that could have easily been avoided.

Friday came and I had a bad headache, my throat was sore, and everytime I swallowed my throat and upper stomach area hurt.

They sent us to a room and tested me for strep, covid, the flu, and something else which all came back negative. We went home after they prescribed us medication and told us to come back Monday if it progressed. Saturday around 1 00 we bought a bunch of soft food for me to eat because I couldnt swallow. For dinner my mom made me soup but I couldnt bring myself to eat it. I was hungry but the thought of eating made me want to puke. I was in pain and I took medicine at the exact moment I could take it again. I slept in the living room with my mom and around 3 AM we both got up again to get my medicine.

{"id": 10429, "data": " 21M   5'4FT   100LB   White  Ongoing Gastrointestinal, Anxiety,   Depression Issues for 7  Years With No Proper Diagnosis 21 years old, male, weigh a measly 100 pounds and am a white American.\nMedication  Escitalopram 20MG, Famotidine 40MG,   supplements of Vitamin D and Folic Acid.\nDrugs  None.\nIssues  Gastrointestinal, Anxiety, and Depression for 7  years.\nA little history of the issues. All 3 issues started receiving care in 2014 when I had convinced my parents to start getting me looked at. I cannot say when they actually started, childhood memory is not great, but it was around 2014. In early 2015 I had an endoscopy and colonoscopy. As far as I am aware both of those came back with nothing of note. They put me on antibiotics and sent me on my way. I just looked at my medical records. Colonoscopy was said to be visually normal. Endoscopy says visually normal besides \"mild cobblestoning in the stomach.\" After my yearly check up with the  , I was given blood work to test for thyroid issues. Everything came back normal in my blood besides low Vitamin D and Folic acid, thus the reason for the supplements.\nThe main symptoms themselves are as follows \nAbdominal pain. I have abdominal pain and discomfort that I would place near the navel. It is not usually nausea, just discomfort, and pain.\nShaking  For the last year or so I have had full body uncontrollable shaking. I am fully conscious during these bouts of shakiness. I am not the least bit shaky at any time outside of these fits.\nHot Flashes  I will get hot flashes. Usually spread across my full body and make it feel as if I am burning up.\nThese 3 issues are almost always linked. However, the hot flashes and shaking do not seem to occur on their own. They are always seemingly accompanied by abdominal pain. The abdominal pain itself however can occur separately from the others. Due to the longevity of this issue, I have been documenting when these events occur over the last year. Since recording, there have been 70 days I have recorded some kind of issue on. On average these issues happen every 5.94 days. The amount of calories I consume on these days is on average 1,220 and water is 917ml. On an average day, however, these numbers are closer to 1,929 and 1,181ml. So, while every 6 days is not exactly constant, it sure does feel constant.\nThe mental issues, on the other hand, are their own separate issue. I have very extreme anxiety and depression. I am almost always in a constant state of anxiety. It has prevented me from doing pretty much anything social for many years. Most recently it had me panicking so much that I could not bring myself to go to my girlfriend's mother's funeral. My damn girlfriend's mother's funeral. This very well may lead to her being my soon to be ex girlfriend. None the less it is definitely something I will regret for most likely the rest of my life. Besides that, it has kept me from seeing even her many times in the past. There are also several other notable times I can think of. Several years ago, a friend I had met online come up to see me from a city 4 hours away. She picked me up, I was feeling anxious but sucked it up, we drove around 40 minutes or so then she wanted to go to the mall. I could not. She then proceeded to drive me the 40 minutes back to my house. Another time last year my grandmother came up to see me and I was so anxious that I all but had to be forced to go see her. She has never done me wrong in my life and there is no reason for me to have been anxious about her, but I was.\nThe anxiety and gastrointestinal issues do definitely play off each other. The extent of which I am not sure. It has been suggested that maybe the stomach issues are all mental, they are not. I can assure you of that. I have been living in a constant state of anxiety over my stomach for many years. Not so much that I am constantly thinking about it, but it is in the back of my mind. I will not eat around other people in fear that my stomach will act up. I will hardly ever go out in fear of my stomach. I am not sure how long this issue has persisted, but I know it has been longer than the 7 years since I started receiving medical attention. As far back as I remember I have refused to eat in cars. Does not matter if it is a 16 hour road trip I will not eat until we arrive. I have not gone out to eat since I was probably early teens if even a teen. I can vividly remember when I was around 12 not wanting to go to the beach for the first time in fear of my stomach. Pretty much I have been dealing with these issues for as long as I can remember. In high school, I was also extremely and constantly truant and skipping class. It was always because I would have a stomach issue or anxiety. I was truant enough that they eventually had police bring me to school, have me meet with a truancy officer, letters from the county. Basically, the whole thing. So, these issues have considerably affected my life. It has not helped that people in my life really didn't start taking it seriously until recently.\nAs far as my bowel movements go, I am not sure how abnormal they are. I would say it is somewhat of a revolving cycle of constipation, diarrhea, and normal. If I had to guess it is probably normal 5 7 days and either constipation or diarrhea on the other 2 7 days. I also usually do defecate at least once a day. There are sometimes where I will go one or two days with nothing, but those only happen maybe once every two weeks. Gas wise I hardly have any flatulence. Burp wise though I have a lot of gas. I am not sure how to measure that, but it feels like a lot more than normal.\nI will touch on depression quickly. Depression is not that much of an issue. I have come to accept it over the years. In early 2020 I did have a bout of depression and over the course of 2 months, I spent 13 days entirely in bed. However, since then I have been fine. \nI will also touch on my weight and water because I foresee it being a talking point. My weight is extremely low. I am aware that I have a BMI of 17.1. My weight was around 110, but during one of my bouts of depression in 2020, I lost around 10 pounds over the course of 4 days in bed with little to no food or water. I also had a case of food poisoning or something in early 2020 that made me even wearier of food than normal. I try to eat as much as I can, but due to my issues, I never force myself to eat or to eat more than I am comfortable with. As for the low amount of liquids I consume, it is an ongoing struggle. I have been trying to drink more water but never seem to successfully stay with a good amount of water. I have been able to drink close to 2,000 a day but can never keep it up for more than some days.\nI think that about covers everything. I have pretty much given you my entire life story.\nTLDR \nAbdominal pain. I have abdominal pain and discomfort that I would place near the navel. It is not usually nausea, just discomfort, and pain.\nShaking  For the last year or so I have had full body uncontrollable shaking. I am fully conscious during these bouts of shakiness. I am not the least bit shaky at any time outside of these fits.\nHot Flashes  I will get hot flashes. Usually spread across my full body and make it feel as if I am burning up.\nAnxiety  A lot of anxiety. Enough to stop me from doing pretty much anything social.\nOver the last year, there have been 70 days where I had some kind of issue.", "label": [[56, 63, "DISEASE"], [67, 77, "DISEASE"], [206, 218, "DRUG"], [273, 283, "DRUG"], [324, 331, "DISEASE"], [337, 347, "DISEASE"], [993, 1000, "SYMPTOM"], [1169, 1183, "SYMPTOM"], [1192, 1206, "SYMPTOM"], [1275, 1281, "SYMPTOM"], [1304, 1308, "SYMPTOM"], [1772, 1786, "SYMPTOM"], [1792, 1806, "SYMPTOM"], [2410, 2425, "SYMPTOM"], [2430, 2440, "DISEASE"], [2484, 2491, "DISEASE"], [3134, 3141, "SYMPTOM"], [3374, 3381, "SYMPTOM"], [3511, 3518, "SYMPTOM"], [3545, 3552, "DISEASE"], [3801, 3808, "DISEASE"], [4730, 4737, "DISEASE"], [5172, 5184, "SYMPTOM"], [5186, 5194, "DISEASE"], [5268, 5280, "SYMPTOM"], [5284, 5292, "DISEASE"], [5650, 5660, "DISEASE"], [5670, 5680, "DISEASE"], [5787, 5797, "DISEASE"], [6110, 6120, "DISEASE"], [6821, 6835, "SYMPTOM"], [6844, 6858, "SYMPTOM"], [6927, 6933, "SYMPTOM"], [6956, 6960, "SYMPTOM"], [7288, 7295, "DISEASE"], [225, 235, "DRUG"], [259, 268, "DRUG"], [729, 740, "DRUG"], [3557, 3580, "DISEASE"]]}

Around Thanksgiving I started feeling a weird sensation in my lower right abdomen pelvic area that felt like pressure, movement, kind of even like a fetus kicking (although I wasnt pregnant at the time). No pain. I also noticed a small lump when I pressed down on that same spot. I brushed it off and didnt get it checked. \nFast forward to April of this year I had recently found out I was pregnant and at my first 9 week OB appointment. The   did a pelvic exam and told me she felt a lump. I let her know I was aware of it and that it had shown up months before I became pregnant. She said its unfortunate, but because Im pregnant theres nothing that can be done to investigate the mystery lump and weird sensations until after I give birth at the end of this year. She was also not interested in referring me anywhere. She did check my ovaries with the ultrasound machine and said they were clear. \nObviously Im not about to wait several months to find out if something sinister is going on in my body. I went to the ER and they did a more in depth ultrasound and said they were seeing a mass, but they were confident it was a lipoma and nothing serious, mainly because Im only 26 and have no other symptoms of being ill like weight loss or vomiting. \nThen last week I had my 17 week OB appointment and I was being seen by a different   that day simply because my usual was unavailable. I updated her about my lump and told her the ER diagnosed it as a lipoma. She felt it herself and said thats not a lipoma. She didnt know what it was, but said its likely not a lipoma because its shaped differently and is hard and doesnt move when pressed on. \nShe said she would refer me to a surgeon to have it further looked at and sent me home. That was a week ago and Ive heard nothing back about when I can get in with the specialist. Im trying not to freak out, but I cant help but worry its cancer and that Ill leave my 14 month old daughter and soon to be second baby without a mother.

Headaches, inability to concentrate, significant decline in cognitive function, body aches, night sweats, hot flushes and my menstrual cycle has stopped completely. I also cannot lose any weight, even when restricted to under 800cal. This one is somewhat newer  whenever I drink anything cold (fridge or colder) I feel a lump in my throat. It feels like there is something stuck in my throat. I also have a bump on my neck when pushed, I can feel the same thing. \nOnce or so a week, I cannot physically get out of bed. I sleep on and off until mid afternoon. These episodes are preceded by a sinus headache the day before or sometimes two days before. On these days, I have constant diarrhea and weakness, my nose is always blocked but I dont cough anything up. The mucus will not blow out, or cough out so I have no choice but to swallow it, leading to extreme nausea. Nothing taken works to dry up this mucus. Can I please stress, this is not my depression! \nI asked for a FBC including my thyroid level. All came back within normal ranges. Including, suspiciously my iron levels. I mention this because I have a long history with anemia and my red meat (I dont do leafy greens) consumption is non existent. If I dont eat meat for a week Ill become anemic. \nI asked my GP also, if I have to be well to get the covid vaccine (allocated Pfizer). All he would say (repeatedly when asked several times) is that I would have to provide a negative covid test to receive the vaccine. I know I cant get a flu shot if Im not well so this is holding me up getting the vaccine. I understand my once GP is sounding less than ideal. Because of the medications Im on and my complex history, Ive very reluctant to change drs at this point in time. \nAny help would be appreciated. I really am at my wits end and sick to death of being so sick.", "label": [[137, 147, "DISEASE"], [168, 175, "DISEASE"], [177, 181, "DISEASE"], [318, 330, "SYMPTOM"], [891, 902, "SYMPTOM"], [1041, 1046, "SYMPTOM"], [1087, 1095, "DISEASE"], [1207, 1216, "SYMPTOM"], [1299, 1311, "SYMPTOM"], [1528, 1532, "SYMPTOM"], [1614, 1618, "SYMPTOM"], [1805, 1813, "SYMPTOM"], [1890, 1898, "DISEASE"], [1903, 1911, "SYMPTOM"], [1950, 1955, "SYMPTOM"], [1973, 1978, "SYMPTOM"], [2001, 2006, "SYMPTOM"], [2069, 2075, "SYMPTOM"], [2112, 2117, "SYMPTOM"], [2155, 2165, "DISEASE"], [2199, 2206, "SYMPTOM"], [2340, 2346, "DISEASE"], [2519, 2532, "DRUG"], [2651, 2656, "DISEASE"], [2706, 2714, "DRUG"], [155, 165, "DRUG"], [183, 193, "DISEASE"], [258, 286, "DISEASE"], [695, 705, "DISEASE"], [1196, 1204, "DRUG"]]}

Heres the information I have so far. This has all been relayed to me by my mom siblings so I may have some small details wrong.\nOn Mon. (2 days ago) he went to the emergency room with severe abdominal pain and was vomiting and hyperventilating. The ER found that his white blood count was very high and that he had a septic gallbladder infection through a CT and ultrasound. They started him on antibiotics and pain meds and admitted him.\nOn Tues. they didnt do anything new other than come back and forth with different plans. They originally planned on doing an MRCP to find where exactly the blockage was and then do an ERCP to remove it. They never did the MRCP.\nThis morning (Wed) there seemed to be some miscommunication and his bilirubin levels may have gone down so they started taking him to be prepped for gallbladder removal because they said they wanted to get it out while there wasnt a blockage. At the last minute they said that bilirubin levels were up and they couldnt do the surgery so they took him back to his room and decided to do the ERCP this afternoon. They attempted it but werent able to advance the scope because he has scar tissue from ulcers (which he told them hes had prior to the surgery).\nThe next plan would be to inject a dye into his liver to find the blockage and remove it and then remove his gallbladder after that.\nNow thats not even the plan anymore. The only plan they have is to get an MRI.\nThere always seems to be a delay in getting information from the staff and they keep having to put off procedures until they can find a surgeon who is willing to do the procedure. The only thing theyve really done since he was admitted on Monday is give him pain meds and antibiotics.\nWhat should we do? Do we request he be transferred to a different hospital?

{"id": 10487, "data": "Could I have developed an intestinal colon problem at 37 years old? In late 2019, I was getting ready for bed one night as usual when my pulse rate and blood pressure started rapidly fluctuating up and down, I felt lightheaded, very malaise, rapid urination, pain in the bladder bowel lower abdominal area. I also had stomach pain. My primary care   said I have 'dysautonomia' aka autonomic dysfunction as best as he could tell. We used Sertraline off label to  help quell symptoms. However, it never really helped too much even up to 100mg day. I've had severe exercise intolerance since. I'm talking like...mow the yard for 5 minutes and 160 heart rate and shortness of breath. Pedal on the exercise bike for 20 minutes daily and send it to 150 160 when not even pedaling that hard. Jogging 10 feet in the house to play with the dog sends me heart rate to 120 130. My heart rate in 5 seconds can go 120, 110, 105, 98, 86, 84, 80 and bounce up and down similar to POTS. \nI've had a lot of bowel issues since. Then in February 2020, my mother must have picked up a virus somewhere like gastroenteritis. She vomited more violently than anyone I have ever seen for about 3 days. I never vomited, but myself and another elderly member of the household had black diarrhea, which my mother also had. I had it for probably 4 5 days. Eventually it went away, but then I was having issues with my stomach being inflamed. Got an upper endoscopy and it was very red and inflamed, but biopsy for cancer and bacteria (H Pylori, etc.) was negative. Then I started feeling 'pulsing' in my stomach that my gastro   couldn't explain. I could feel my pulse in my stomach. I feel pulses from my heartbeat all over my body, which I used to not feel. I am hypersensitive. Very hyper knee tap reflexes. \nI've been lightheaded since late 2019. When I sleep 4 5 hours, I'm not as lightheaded. When I sleep 6 10 hours, I am way more lightheaded than if I sleep the 4 5 hours. A 2018 in lab sleep study showed no central apneas, 4.7AHI and about 50 respiratory events (mostly hypopneas and RERAs) over 2.75 hours. A mid 2020 in lab study  showed 60  central apneas. I'm on bilevel treatments that, based on those settings in the lab, brought everything down to 0.\nMy intestines are reeling every day. Bad gas, constant bubbling gurgling in my stomach and intestines very loudly, some days I feel a stiffness about an inch or two below my belly button. It's possible that it could just be soft stool sitting there in the colon. I used to get a \"crumpling cardboard\" feeling in that area when I bent over in 2020. A little bit of bladder wall thickening was noted on a CT scan, for an unknown reason but otherwise nothing. In certain postures of bending forward over a bathroom sink or sitting on the toilet, my ears ring. It feels like my blood pressure drops and it does sometimes.\nI had a tilt table test. Negative for POTS syndrome. The cardiologist asked if I had COVID since may who have had it show my symptoms. I haven't, to my knowledge. Then she tested my system response and gave me a little nitroglycerin pill. Instead of heart rate increasing and blood pressure decreasing, the heart rate dropped to 40 and bp to like 96 56 and I fainted. She said that indicated that my sympathetic nervous system overcompensated. \nI've had my heart checked, 3 holter monitors for a month, Stress EKG (treadmill), Echocardiogram (found a very light 3.8cm aortic ectasia), pelvic MRI at the hospital showed mild bladder wall thickening for an unknown reason, gastro  , 2 sleep docs, I've been on CPAP and now on moderate 9 5 repssure BiLevel as assigned by sleep docs, primary care docs, lots of blood work, 3 ER visits for palpitations, lightheadedness, etc. I'm lightheaded daily. Poor sleep every night. I nod off in the car on a 10 minute trip back from the store. I've questioned Narcolepsy, but have not been tested yet. Endocrinologist checked thyroid and did blood work. Checked for pheochromocytomas. Nada. I'm wondering if I should have a 24 hour urine catecholamines test at some point to check for some sort of adrenal disorder. I get short of breath during the day sometimes. I get \"pulses\" up in my head like the blood isn't flowing properly or something, but they're pulses of lightheadedness that I don't think it any kind of blood clot, stroke, etc. It's related to whatever is causing this and those pulses just started a couple of weeks ago.

Gender  Male \nAge  23 \nWeight  330 340 (I was on a diet for three months leading up to the surgery) \nHeight  60 \nAfter two ER visits in three months, I finally had my gallbladder removed last Thursday (June 24). The day of the surgery, I dont remember much. I know I had pain, but I think the pain meds and the anesthesia helped to reduce a majority of it. The next day, however, phew. It hurt bad. I took pain meds, got up and walked a little bit, but man, it was hurting. Especially having those random muscle spasms... that didnt feel great, either. \nSaturday and Sunday, I started to feel better. I was getting up and down easier, walking around better, had my bowel movements, and I felt okay. Not great by any means, but I was doing fair. But on Monday, I woke up and felt the best I had been since surgery. I was up and moving even better, went out for a drive with the family, and even went to our church to help with Vacation Bible School. I was scared to climb up and down stairs because I didnt want to overdo anything, but to my surprise, I felt fine. I was even told by a couple people that they wouldve never guessed I had gallbladder surgery just a few days prior. \nIve helped out with the churchs VBS Monday, Tuesday, and today (Wednesday). Today felt a little different, though. Id notice a dull pain in my mid back and would immediately have a seat. It only happened a couple times, but my fear was I was close to overdoing myself. So I was sitting down 95  of the service. \nWhen I got home, I walked around a bit, felt alright, and had a seat in my recliner (thats where Ive been sleeping and resting). A couple hours later, my right shoulder started to hurt. Like, this the most pain Ive had since the day after surgery. Is it possible this could be gas left over? Or is it something serious? Did I overdo something? \nA couple of factors that I feel could be the cause of the mid back pain and maybe the shoulder pain... \n   Honestly, my diet hasnt been too great. Ive had Subway a few times, had a cheeseburger a few days ago from a fast food restaurant, a cheeseburger today (homemade), some chips, a couple of cookies, some candy, chocolate milk, diet sodas, 7 Up, and yeah. Pretty much crap that led me to getting the gallbladder out to begin with. But Im scheduled to get back on track with my diet tomorrow. \n   The day of my surgery, my parents felt it would be a great idea to put two pillows on the recliner  one on the seat, and then one for my back. Ive been sleeping and resting like that since Thursday. Im not sure if that has caused some discomfort or not since the pillow isnt really covering my whole back? I dont know. I tried doing it tonight but it didnt feel too bueno. So now Im sitting in the recliner with no pillows. \nA few other notes... \n   When I try to take a deep breath, my right shoulder hurts, as well as the right side of my stomach (around where my gallbladder was). \n   I was laughing a little bit the first few days (hurt like heck, so I tried stopping a lot). Today, the laughing didnt hurt. \n   My surgeon said it would take 7 10 days for me to return to normal activity. Im sadly thinking the 4 5 days I took it was too soon. \n   I have really, really bad worrying anxiety fear. Im scared to the point where its OCD. Ill check my wounds every day to see if everything is fine, for instance. Im beyond scared that Im going to have jaundice, have an infection, have a wound open up, have some type of internal bleeding, develop a clot, have one of those gallbladder clamp things fall off, etc. \nIf youve made it this far in the reading, Im sorry for how long it is.

That was accompanied with parasthesia and burning in all my limbs and head. I then got an EMG of my limbs that were perfect. Also got a MRI of the C Spine that was normal. The only symptoms I am still currently having are nonpainful muscle twitches but mostly on the left side of my body and a lot in my face eye leg, constant nausea, raspy voice, brain fog, fatigue, oversleeping, weird gait, trouble swallowing chewing, chewing food causes dizziness, trouble talking loud or in a high pitched voice, and desensitization of the head inside of mouth.

I'm a 29 year old female with no health conditions to my knowledge other than gum disease. I went to have a root scaling and planing (deep cleaning) for my gums last Thursday and due to how sensitive he knew my gums would be , he said he was gonna give me a little extra anesthesia.  I can't remember if he did two or three shots into the mouth but at least two injections,  plus the anesthetic gel he liberally applied . Within a minute or two my heart was racing and felt like it was beating too hard and was gonna beat out of my damn chest. I  mentioned this and he said it's a normal side effect of anesthesia and then left the room.  The dental hygienists began working on my gums but I couldn't get calm bc of the very noticeable heart racing and intense beating and my legs began to shake. They said it was a panic attack but it really felt more physical than mental in my experiences with panic attacks . They offered me laughing gas so i used that and got through the awful two yours of work. Face was numb and I could barely even blink for 4 hours . \nOf course the anesthesia finally wore off after those 4 hours after but it's been a week and I'm still feeling a rapid heart rate as well as sudden feelings of tension in the chest .

It went on all day along with severe diarrhea. To make this as short as possible, I had diarrhea anywhere from 3 6 times a day for 3 weeks. Vomiting was about every other day. The pain during those 3 weeks was atrocious. Mostly in my upper abdomen, but Ive also had severe cramping in lower as well. Around week 4, diarrhea mostly stopped but i have had consistent vomiting after eating ANYTHING that continues today. Its not so much a forceful gagging vomiting, its like the food or liquid is coming up slowly. I should also mention my nausea isnt severe, but occasionally happens. I run mild fevers every night ( 99.5 F) and have migraines constantly. My hands have began to get super shakey and I can tell im not as mentally sharp. I even will throw up after drinking water. After i had red blood in my vomit one day, i went to ER. They did an MRI and found my liver was  20 cm but everything else was normal. Blood tests and metabolic screening was all normal. They suggested i might have IBS, but im not sure. My physician tested me for bacteria and parasites, and did another blood test. Everything came back normal. Finally, i went to the gastroenterologist and i was tested for celiac disease which came back normal. I had an endoscopy done and had stomach inflammation but that was it. The other thing they talked to me about was my gallbladder. I had an ultrasound, an MRCP, and HIDA scan done. The ultrasound suggested a dilated biliary duct but found no stones nor sludge. My MRCP showed no stones and my HIDA scan came back normal. The pain had been manageable since week 4, but at the start of week 9 (september 26), I started having pain in my lower abdomen again. This time the pain was so bad i mistook it for severe period cramps. I couldnt stand up all the way or i would have a shooting pain. I had to walk hunchbacked or just lay down. The diarrhea is also back and Im now vomiting after eating things with even no fat like applesauce, bread, water, pedialyte. My unprofessional opinion is that maybe my gallbladder should be ruled out and this might be a digestive disease at this point.

I weighed about 225 230. A week before my fusion was scheduled I was rear ended, and my back turned to spondylolithesis slipping my l3 s1 vertebrae. My knee also went through my dashboard. Spine   put me in a brace till my knee got fixed so I could walk properly after fusion.  \nKnee   does arthroscopic surgery, so on to back surgery. I had a 2 day OLIF in sept. 2018, this   recorded how loose tendons and everything were and couldnt wait to show me. I was walking 2 miles a day every day out of back surgery following drs orders to a T. Everything was perfect, I didnt even use pain meds after the first week, Was doing great.  \nJan 2019 rolls around and all the sudden I cant eat. I mean I can chew and swallow but literally everything was coming up days later, rotten and undigested. I refused to go to the   for this for about a month and lost about 20 lbs. my now husband made me go to the  , who referred me to a gi specialist. Gi specialist(who was an idiot, sry not sry) does an egd colonoscopy which I died during and had to be resuscitated ( thank you anesthesia team) but I walked away with GERD, Esophagitis,  hiatial hernia, chronic gastritis and 4 massive (one was 4 in) polyps, all tubular adenomas, all non cancerous thankfully and some other small stuff. \nAbout two days later I started vomiting coffee ground blood and spent 3 days admitted in the er overflow with no explanation as to why.  So I discharged myself and went to do an emptying study.  My t1 2 time was 197 mins.  Gi diagnosed me with gastroparesis, told me loosing weight will help and eat as much fiber as possible. At this point I was down about 50 lbs and still not able to hold anything down soooo I got a second opinion at cleveland clinic, tested positive for vgkc antibodies. Went back a month later for smart pill testing, my small intestines took nearly 30 hrs to empty and my colon clocked in at 74. So I was diagnosed with autoimmune gi dysmotility.\nThen shit got weird (er?) saw a rheum and geneticist and I have hEDS. But by now i had lost about 90 lbs in 7 months, they went to put me on TPN but my general surgeon messed up my port and it kept infiltrating, so I got it replaced. Fast forward through 10 months of me saying this thing isnt right and pointing to the exact spot of my azygos vein (spoilers) I had two cts and 2 X rays that all said hell yeah her ports in the right spot.  So we get a gallbladder ultrasound and yup, got me some gallstones. But my port gets to the point where I cant even run my 16 hr infusions at 1 2 volume over 24 hours without screaming a half an hour into it. Saline wont infuse, but my infusion company insists on still trying.  So about two weeks into that and Ive had enough, I couldnt even flush my port without shaking it hurt so bad. She orders a port due study and They placed it in the azygos vein 10 months ago and it had a massive clot on it. ( cause if my body is gunna mess up at this point go big or go home, right?) so   calls, says he doesnt want to place another port for me but still wants to take my gall bladder.  Nopity nope nope. So IR replaces said port, everything goes well, I stayed awake for this one and saw with my own two eyeballs that it got blood return. Now Im left with constant upper back pain and spine cracking anytime I breathe but hey Im alive right? Doing good. \nI get my gallbladder removed a few days later (with a different  ) and all went well.  Except no I have a ton of pain under my rib on my left side and the last couple ribs are visibly protruding. The one bowel movement I do get a month is now ghostly white and if I eat anything with fat in it, it sends intense pain over my whole left side. Then my knee locks and I cant move it, Well my patellar tendon is almost completely calcified and theres another one too (cant remember)and decreased bone density in my bad leg. Ct of my pelvis reveals dystrophic calcification through out retroperiteneal (?) cavity and my hip.  Then I get a rash on my face that just will not go away,   orders Ana and its positive, sends me to a rheum.  Rheum shakes my hands, immediately diagnosis me with raynauds, confirmed with nailfold capillary test thing and tells me I have scleroderma but she wants to run tests to be sure.. test come back negative for scl antibodies so I dont have scleroderma. I do however have skin tightening, talengestias (?) and all the symptoms, just dont have it. My esophagus doesnt want to work anymore, I developed almost a tremor to the point where my husband thought I was having seizures. I also do the full body cramping thing from time to time. Just lose control of everything and my body essentially tightens every muscle, curls me into a ball on the floor for 10 15 minutes then slowly releases. That one is probably the most painful.  Went to a neuro, he didnt know. I dont know anymore, Im underweight and still loosing, starting to loose sanity and hope.
