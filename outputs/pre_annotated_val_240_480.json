{"text":"Please help re diagnosis tx options re chronic tongue pain sores Hey gang,\n25M\nHave had pain on the rear sides (folliate pappillae area) of my tongue for 1  years now.\nFeels like there are cuts there, but at most can see very small (1mm long at most) red marks.\nUsually   will wake up in the morning slightly sore, and will usually be at a   3 4  all day. The pain is always there, but to differing degrees   depending on how much I talk. Talking exacerbates the issue, and even a   small amount will flare this up.\nTx     Have had the molars slightly smoothed to remove any sharp edges,  have  improved tongue posture, and have been reviewed by an oral  pathologist,  who confirmed not cancerous (visual assessment), but  couldnt give any  diagnosis treatment. Next step is a blood test, but  unsure if this will  be of any use, as can only think of iron b  deficiencies, of which I  supplement   eat pretty well. Chlorohexedine  seems to help slightly, but not by much, and started to stain  teeth tongue after a couple of weeks anyway, so not worth it.\nWould really appreciate some help, as is quite depressing at this point.","label":[]}

{"text":"Tics started by a bad experience with alcohol and cannabis Hey r askdocs!\nI'm just looking to enquire if anyone knows of a similar experience to this one, or if there is anything that can be done to treat the following symptoms  )\nAbout seven months ago, my girlfriend   F18   and I   M18   went to a friend's birthday party. My girlfriend is roughly 5'5, 70 kilos in weight, is currently taking birth control medication daily, does not smoke tobacco or cannabis regularly, and does not have any current medical conditions. I am 5'11, 75 kilos in weight, currently prescribed and taking 100mg of sertraline daily for depression, I do not regularly smoke tobacco or cannabis. In the past I have been diagnosed with depression, generalised anxiety, panic disorder without agoraphobia, and moderate symptoms of psychosis, all of which have now receded to the point of me not having to deal with them anymore. There were a fair amount of drugs and alcohol in circulation at the party, I only had a little to drink, perhaps 6 8 standard drinks of vodka with mixers in the timespan of about 5 hours, and my girlfriend had close to 10 13 standard drinks of multiple forms of alcohol (vodka, malibu, champagne, wine and cruisers) in about the same 5 or 6 hour timespan, and three cones of cannabis in the 6th hour roughly. After smoking the cannabis my girlfriend said she wanted to sit down, so we went to go sit together on the couch. After perhaps five minutes of sitting on the couch having a quite drunk conversation, she began seeming more and more intoxicated, alternating between crying, laughing, and various other emotions every few seconds. After about 15 minutes of this, she suddenly said that she felt quite sick, and we went to the laundry where there was a bucket that our friend kindly provided. My girlfriend threw up for an hour or a little more, and as she was throwing up while I was holding her, she started having motor tics. This was quite scary as she had never had any tics in the past, and now was suddenly having tics every five to ten seconds. The whole time she was also crying, saying she felt disgusting and wanted it to stop, and I tried to comfort her as best I could. Eventually after an hour and a half of vomiting and tics, it calmed down to a tic every 10 minutes or so. At this point I had to leave the party, as my dad was waiting outside to pick me up. She stayed the night at the host's house, and woke up the following morning feeling quite disgusting, as can be expected after such a night. Strangely though, the tics persisted throughout that day, as she began frequently experiencing waves of nausea that in turn induced tics, now about every 5 minutes. This calmed down over the next week, but the tics still persisted, growing more few and far between, eventually numbering about 20 a day. Now, seven months later, her tics still are quite prevalent, coming through whenever she feels gross or gets anxious. The tics manifest in the form of a quick move of the head and shoulders, and usually a vocal sound. She experiences the tics still daily, and they sadly do not seem to be going anywhere. I was looking to this subreddit for any advice any of you guys would have or even any similar experiences, anything would be truly helpful. She has talked to her GP about this but they brushed it off for no apparent reason, saying 'oh that doesn't sound very nice', and providing no explanation or advice at all. I have so far found nothing in medical literature that coresponds with her experience, and honestly neither of us know what to do. Anything at all would be an immense help, thank you all and much love to all of you in these hard times  )\nTL DR  Girlfriend experiences motor tics initiated by a bad experience with cannabis and alcohol, and have persisted for over 6 months, any advice would be immensely appreciated  )","label":[[396,409,"DRUG"],[596,606,"DRUG"],[617,627,"DISEASE"],[714,724,"DISEASE"],[738,745,"DISEASE"],[747,761,"DISEASE"],[808,817,"DISEASE"]]}

I am a homosexual male and have given oral in the last week and the last time I engaged in anal sex was 3 months prior. I am the receptive agent. My relationship is monogamous (no other sexual partners). \nI have a painless, red, fleshy lump in the form of a solitary nodule right where my scrotum meets my inguinal region on the left side. It is noticeably red pink compared to the rest of my skin and does not seem to possess a white head and as far as I can tell there is no hair growing from it. It seems to be approx 2cm in diameter. I only noticed it today while urinating and I am concerned since painless solitary growths as I'm told are usually not good so I just want to exclude that possibility. It seems to be fixed under the skin like a skin tag. It does not indent with pressure. It simply bounces back. I do get razor burn pretty easily but again, this does not show a head at all unlike the ingrown hairs that appear after shaving. \nI have not been immunized against herpes and have not noticed any ulcers or bumps anywhere else on my body. I am caught up with the rest of my vaccines. I do not have any other systemic issues or co morbids however I have previously been diagnosed with a vitamin D deficiency for which I did not adequately supplement. I occasionally have migraines since childhood about once per month resolving with rest or Tylenol. \nHeart problems and diabetes runs in the family however neither of my parents have been diagnosed with these problems (only their parents have), but my father has idiopathic hypertension.

{"text":"Intense Head Pressure in Dreams  21M   For the past year or so, I've occasionally had these dreams where it feels like there is a really intense build up of pressure (particularly at the ears).

A lot of the time, I also can't move my body in the dream and I have a feeling of pins and needles throughout my body as well.\nI can also trigger an episode of this by sort of tensing my neck and \"focusing\" on my ears while I'm half awake, I'm not quite sure how to explain it.

{"text":"Undiagnosed Stroke (18 M) 5' 11'' 150 pound Caucasian Around 2 years ago I started noticing an acute sharp pain (gradually grew worse) on the left side of the back of my head whenever my blood pressure rose (noticeably during intercouse but occasionally during exercise, though less severely during the latter), along with this included immense exhaustion (no, not because of the intercouse, the symptoms were typically immediately following even a few seconds of my blood pressure spiking though originally it took a longer period of time to become unbearable). This carried on for some time, at least a few months at my mother's (my parents are divorced, while living with my mother she repeatedly invalidated my condition stating that she noticed nothing wrong with me and made sure to mention that I \"should stop acting spoiled and get over it\" whilst regularly texting my father her side of the story, asserting I \"just wanted attention.\" (I'm mentioning this to paint a clear picture of prolonged avoidance and covering up of my condition being a normality relative to the way my family behaves). Anyways, I started getting mild confusion along with tingling on the right side of my head as well after the sharp pain. One day after waking up I felt an indescribable amount of pressure on the left side of my head, I touched it and blacked out for a second, I brought this up with my father and he disregarded it, in short, telling me he was busy with work and that we would talk about it tonight (we didn't, I was taken to a walk in clinic a month later that essentially told me I didn't have a virus after my dad micromanaged everything all while I was trying to get to the ER because I had gone completely blind for 2 days a few weeks prior to the clinic visit). I went to school after having noticed the liquid mass, with me getting there early and being able to see the bump on my head immediately when looking in the mirror. I wasn't able to walk in a straight line, swaying back and forth, with my head at a 45 angle from just the weight, I remember having slurred speech and talking to my English teacher with me being completely incoherent other than saying the words \"That's ominous\" flash forward again and over time it developed to a point in which I'd have even more concerning symptoms including forementioned balance problems, blurry vision, immense confusion, a loss of bladder control for a brief period, slurred speech, even more amounts of tingling on the right side of my forehead and back top of head (on the same side), pupils dilating like crazy, vertigo, pins and needles (tingling but there was some nuance to it that I can't quite remember) muscle spasms, popping I could feel that mimicked my pulse on the bump that went down and hardened, a running water sound (like the sound of water in a sinks pipeline before it reaches the faucet, which was also identical to my pulse and sped up according to blood pressure, same with popping) and quite literally every symptom I've found that happens to be one associated with stroke. The swelling eventually went down and formed a hard bump that I've been told contrasting opinions about, with some claiming it's a lymph node to others throwing that theory out of the window and guaranteeing it was a fat deposit or countless other reasons to have a small, sometimes malleable protrusion that was never there before and has now gone from many inches in diameter to something maybe half an inch wide. With regards to cognition I've had countless blackouts, trouble understanding, memory difficulties (short term in most cases), I was unable to do basic tasks such as reading or remembering where dishes go (I had a moment in which I tried reading a Chinese takeout Menu for a good hour, just sitting there trying to understand as the entirety of my right head was tingling, confused out of my mind, and thought that I would never have a normal life or recover from where I was cognitively. Just for some background I was a Straight A student for the first two years of high school taking advanced classes and a few AP (writing 30 some page essays and being in the 98th and 99th percentile for all subjects in the state) until I started experiencing black outs and dropping things like paper the last trimester of 2nd year (brought this up as well and though I had a phone at this point (taken from me due to disrespect). I didn't think the symptoms were 911 worthy then. I had an MRI (just brain) after almost a year but without contrast which was deeply encouraged by me, though the physician (not a neurologist..) told me it would damage my kidneys too much (I had no history of kidney problems). By the time the MRI came my symptoms had gone down significantly. Rinse and repeat with dozens of excruciating symptoms that dissipated weeks before the 2nd mri a year later, where I made great effort of saying the symptoms were resolving other than the cognitive issues and tingling, with swelling on the inner side of my neck becoming suddenly noticeable a few weeks before the scheduled imaging and being practically non existent by the day of said imaging (appearing and disappearing to the point where a liquid of such proportion was very alarming when changing dimensions so rapidly). This time it was a \"full head and neck\" mri with contrast, followed by a letter 3 days later with 2 sentences in total stating the brain, neck and blood vessels \"looked normal without concerning findings\" My mom is an ex nurse who was employed at the very same hospital, who has gone as far as committing me to psych (this was after I was detained in the ER from my dad lying about me being suicidal which I have never been and denied in full during the interview). I tried walking several times to the ER until my dad drove me down to repeatedly take me home (no phone and neighbors with guns), this was before any imaging. My mother was claiming I was psychotic before I turned 18 and made an effort to imply that I couldn't do anything to stop her, saying she'd do it again if I didn't stop talking about the symptoms. Every evaluation and auxiliary forum, test and interview came back with no signs of psychosis, with the on board psychiatrist stating he made the diagnosis of me having a quote, \"rare form of psychosis\" with no noticeable normal signs of psychosis (this is practically verbatim but he might of used the word standard. I have the recorded transcript of conversation if I can post that with permission) Long story short, I made an appeal and the judge noted I showed no signs in the presence of anyone except my parents, discluding the incident in which I rejected clean clothes from my dad due to me not wanting to be associated with him whatsoever after him having refused to take me to the ER for a year, then lying in order to get me to psych. The fact that he was bringing me clothes in psych when I only owned a single pair of jeans said enough but for them to note me rejecting them as literally the only cited sign of psychosis other than my parent's testimony was difficult to bear. \n        So, in summary, many symptoms of TIAs or aneurysm that have been acknowledged to be clear indications of neurological problems that get better somewhat over time, usually lasting from a week to multiple months (other than the blindness which was a few days, and the artery popping noise that was constant until about 2 months ago (got an ultrasound before then), with severe cognitive impairment (slurred speech, short blackouts, and extreme confusion, etc.) That have improved but seem to drop substantially after every incident (I can only remember the last few letters I typed while before I had a 120 wpm with high 90s accuracy on a normal day before the first symptom, I've forgotten basic terms from hundreds originating in primary school to hundreds being absorbed during high school, a change in dialect due to a complete loss of vocabulary and difficulty formulating sentences), lengthy psychological evaluations that ended in a ruling of me having no signs of mental illness (was diagnosed with ocd at the age of 5 and was later told I must've grown out of it, mother tried diagnosing me as autistic then too but the 2 seperate professionals I was brought to both declared there were no signs of such), sorry, again, just trying to paint a picture, yeah, that's pretty much it. This had a good thousand typos as I'm not exactly doing cognitively well so apologies if I missed one.

I've asked other doctors about previous bloodtests, and I've been told I'm fine.\nI also cant easily gauge my sugar crashes.

I rest, drink water, and it goes away abruptly. Is this still prediabetes? Why is it so hard to say that it is or isn't?\nOn another note, my uncle has tachycardia, but its apparently not caused by reactive hypoglycemia. Also, my mother has an underactive thyroid. No one has told me that I have thyroid issues.","label":[[16,28,"DISEASE"],[87,96,"DRUG"],[106,115,"DRUG"],[154,160,"DISEASE"],[173,182,"DISEASE"],[350,362,"DISEASE"],[408,420,"DISEASE"],[445,456,"DISEASE"],[502,513,"DISEASE"],[821,833,"DISEASE"],[1033,1044,"DISEASE"],[1122,1133,"DISEASE"],[1177,1189,"DISEASE"]]}

{"text":" 19M  Ongoing constipation with no end in sight 19M, 5\"10, 57.5kg\nHi, I have posted about this before but never really got any answers or advice. Ive had digestive issues my whole life, and have been impacted 3 or 4 times. Specialists have always told me I would grow out of it but alas that wasnt the case. Thankfully Ive now found a specialist who has put me down the path of a colonic transit study which I will be doing soon hopefully for some answers. However I need some kind of temporary advice to handle this current bout of problems.\nSince December last year, I have been taking movicol in one dose or another, first 8 sachets per day due to what I believed to be impaction, then up and down until a GP told me to stay on 4 per day for the foreseeable future until my specialist advised me otherwise after the study. I have honestly never had a bout of digestive problems last this long  Most days now I find myself waking up feeling extremely backed up, then finally being able to go to the toilet (a fair amount, runny) only to feel extremely backed up again by the time I go to bed. Its extremely fatiguing and I cant sustain my studies or job in this state. On one hand I am concerned that the movicol is responsible to some degree, and I am starting to get a bit worried about electrolyte imbalance due to my persistent fatigue. This makes sense to me as movicol retains water in the gut. However on the other side of things, I am worried that ceasing movicol may exacerbate my digestive issues (i tried stopping it for a day and found a noticeable increase in cramping which led me to resume it). Should I be continuing this way with 4 until my study, reducing it to maybe 2 or ceasing it completely? My diet has not changed much if at all in all this time so i doubt that is playing a huge role.\nThanks","label":[]}

At first it felt like touching a fully grown pimple but it was on my heel. It hurt when I walked around so I tried to get rid of it. By now it was really large as this is really the only time I had concrete memories of it. It formed like a purplish greenish scab but was really hard.\nI remember cutting at it with a toenail clippers's file (I didn't know how gross that was until later). I remember that it protruded like a scab but when I cut it in half (I had thought I could get a grip with the clippers and pull it out. I was dumb) it was moist with puss and water (probably sweat). I remember the more I carved out I saw the skin of my foot had a buffer zone between it and the growth. It's was like a webbing of skin. Like fibers of skin had been attached to it. Since my work led to nothing I left it alone and hoped it would fall out. But a week later I noticed it had done the opposite and was actually growing back the part I clipped out.\nThat terrified me so I went back at it and got it this time. The growth had probably made a dent in my foot 34 of a centimeter in depth and 1 to 112 centimeters in diameter. Over time it's smoothed out and slowly grew back. \nPretty sure it was a wart but I thought I would ask  )","label":[]}

{"text":"ADHD middle aged female   1st time trying Stimulant   I stopped taking it   my chest is still tight   \nIve spent my entire life living with debilitating ADHD and not even really knowing it until recently, as a bad family environment left it dismissed since I was first diagnosed at a very young age. Ive lived a life with chronic depression, anxiety, and panic disorder that at one time or another tried anti depressants but had a very bad reaction to them which nearly killed me, so they are a no go ever again. other than that i have pretty much self medicated the symptions with alcohol for years however i am happy to say that i have stopped drinking now and its been a few years. \nThe only other medication ive tried is Xanax and that worked well and it was just a 0.25mg however i did not want to get hooked so i made sure i didnt. I dont even take it regularly and i keep a few of those always stashed away. Other than that i am well versed in natural remedies and take a lot of them daily, i have a pretty good knowledge of vitamins and herbs and know how to eat a good diet, its just that sometimes its not so easy so i dont. \n I recently began treating my ADD and im seeing a Psychiatrist now for a few months And its all not how i envisioned things to be as the medication makes me really sleepy and i have hardly any zing like many people say they have when they take it, it also doesnt make me concentrate as well as people have talked it up like ive heard before.   \nSo my   she has now began prescribing me Adderall 5mg XR (in the beginning, the first few weeks) and told me to take one pill a day. I made the decision to go ahead and try it. I feel it has been extremely inconsistent for me and i have no idea why she started me out on the timed release because i was calling in telling her that i was having problems as it was metabolizing so randomly for me and i was having sleep issues for awhile, i think she isnt that informative when i speak to her so i really dont think she is that great of a   to be honest as when i asked her about my chest she just said its probably anxiety.   \nOk so im trying to get to my point here, i began feeling my chest feeling like it is tight and it also sometimes feels like my throat is tight too. I have NEVER felt my chest like this and i have lived with anxiety every day of my entire life so i know it is not that and is due to the Adderall. My blood pressure is normal as i have been checking it regularly multiple times a day.   \nSo she ended up switching me to the IR but the mg stayed the same at 5mg. Not really much of a difference except that i would have had a more pleasant experience i think if she would have started me out on the IR but oh well. So the chest tightness is in my overall chest area and isnt sharp, its as if ive inhaled something and can feel it in there tight, if that makes sense. hard to explain. It is alarming at times as it feels like something could go wrong and a heart attack could break out. And it isnt consistent, it is quite random.   \nNow heres my question. Its been 17 days that I have stopped taken Adderall completely, and I am still having this chest tightness come up often. What is going on? But now im really concerned because Ive been off Adderall for 17 days. Is the Adderall still in my system? What is this and why is my chest still feeling this way?","label":[[0,4,"DISEASE"],[153,157,"DISEASE"],[330,340,"DISEASE"],[342,349,"DISEASE"],[355,369,"DISEASE"],[404,420,"DRUG"],[725,730,"DRUG"],[1522,1530,"DRUG"],[2095,2102,"DISEASE"],[2314,2321,"DISEASE"],[2393,2401,"DRUG"],[3103,3111,"DRUG"],[3249,3257,"DRUG"],[3278,3286,"DRUG"]]}

{"text":"I fear that I have type 2 diabetes, but maybe some neurological disorder? 20M, 200 lbs   Hello everyone. I just want to start off by saying that I'm one of those people who can go up and down in weight within the years, but for the past few I've been gaining and finally reached what I assume is 200 (A few months ago I went to the   and weighed 190ish, so I probably weigh a bit more now) and I'm around 5'9 or 5'10 in height. My mother has prediabetes, but not full blown. I have this fear that I have diabetes and have even lowered my carb intake, which probably isn't healthy if I don't have it. Over the past few months, I've had a variety of symptoms that have gotten progressively worse, but starting a few days ago   Vertigo Disequilibrium is the culprit. I have these spells, around three times a day that last around an hour at a time that gives a sensation of unsteadiness and unfocused dizziness. I seem to notice that this happens either right after eating or within an hour of eating. The reason I assumed it was diabetes is because it occured after eating a lot of sweets one day. Even when I feel like I've lowered my carb intake to a reasonable amount, I still get dizzy not long after. It's like I can't even eat at this point. Some of my other bothersome symptoms include   Light Sensitivity, especially in  's offices or supermarkets. Like, people give me strange looks because I literally can't keep my eyes open. They make me dizzy and disconnected from reality in a way. Another one is numbness or temporary loss of feeling in pinkie finger, entire hand, or pinkie toe that lasts only a moment. I also tend to feel a lot of twitching sometimes, especially the face but all around. A symptom I used to have that I have very limited now is sharp pains in the middle of the chest or ribcage area, but I have asthma so that could be what's going on there, or even Acid Reflux, but if anyone can give me even a clue as to what's going on with me until I can get a doctors appointment scheduled, that would be a lot of help.

When I flex \"not hard enough\" I  don't seem to get the pain. Also, the pain seems to alleviate a little bit when I rotate my arms counter clock wise while the hand staying as is. Like, I'd need even harder flexing strength to cause the pain. I weigh about 164lbs.\nAlso, another apparent situation is when I do finger curls together with the wrist curls (so extend wrist, extend fingers, flex fingers, flex wrist sequence). Regular wrist curls don't seem to cause the pain. I use 20lbs dumbbells.\nFor the two situations above, only the right wrist has the pain. This has been the case for several years.  I get no pain in daily lives. So I didn't bother seeking medical professionals. \nAlso, one last apparent situation is when I am trying to \"cup\" the bowling ball (flex wrist fingers) using finger tip grip (a grip where the fingers are more extended than the regular grip. With regular grip with house balls, 2 3 of the middle and fourth fingers are inserted in to the hole. With finger tip grip using custom balls, the span between the finger holes and the thumb hole is larger and only 1 3 of the middle and fourth fingers are inserted.). The ball I use is 15lbs. The pain is apparent when I try to \"cup\" the ball really hard. The pain seems to be more apparent when I focus on my index finger to help \"cup\" the ball (or more like try to fold the thumb side of the palm to the wrist). It is less apparent when I focus on the pinky finger side of the palm to flex the wrist. I have not tried this with my left arm. For reference, here is a picture from online that shows what cupping bowling ball looks like in case you are not familiar with bowling.   So if I try to cup more (flex harder) than what's shown in the picture, that's when I get the pain. If I only cup about that much, things are fine.\nThe exact point of pain is where the red circless are in the bottom pictures.   Rectangles are just for my reference.\nI am curious where the pain is coming from (muscle, tendon, ligament, nerve, etc?), why it is getting the pain, and how I should treat it (stretching.. strengthening.. or seeking an offline medical professional..etc).\nThank you very much in advance.","label":[]}

I also often have clear, white or yellow orange mucus on the stools. This has been going on since at least early 2020 when I started iron tablets and became more aware of my poop, but it could just be my normal.\n Maybe once a month or so, Ill pass a large, hard stool that is painful  either a brief, sharp, scratch or cut like pain, or a feeling that the stool is too large and stretching my anus. These stools have slight streaks or spots of bright red blood bloody mucus on it. This often is only visible when removing the stool (with gloves) and inspecting all of it. It doesnt change the toilet water colour and any blood when wiping is none or just specs. I had this a few times in the first half of 2020, but it went away in the summer and only started again in April of this year.\n After passing these large stools, I sometimes later have flatulence where i pass nothing but mucus and a little bright red blood, sometimes as much as a clump (not clots though) or as little as tiny specs in the mucus. I have also passed a little bloody mucus once when straining really hard.\n Occasionally at other times, I have flatulence with minor feral leakage or mucus.\n Just inside the anus is a small, soft, grey ish lump. It doesnt hurt but I think Ive spotted a little blood around it before after a large bowel movement.\n My anus is also red irritated looking with some lumps that are visible when straining, but not sure if these are normal or hemorrhoids.

She has been... quite sexually active. However, I don't have a problem with that. So anyway, we met at night, went to a bar, had a fun time and then went back to her home, where we had sex. There was no pressure on anyone, and we had a relatively fun night together. However before I went home with her, I slightly bit my under lip by accident. I don't know if the wound was even deep enough to have blood coming out of it, but it healed up so fast, I didn't pay any mind. The accidental lip bite happened 5 hours before we had sex. \nWe had oral sex, as well as made out passionately. \nNow today, I'm kind of freaking out, because I read, that if someone has an open cut in their mouth, the other person can transmit HIV (if they have it) through kissing. While I would normally contact her, I also know, that she will be offline for most of the day.

{"text":"Is it worth seeing a rheumatologist? I'm 24, again non binary, 5'9 and approx. 250 lbs. I don't smoke and very rarely drink, and when I do it's rarely more than a single drink. I have been dealing with chronic pain and fatigue for a while (at least two years, but probably most of my life). My pain is primarily in my joints, although it does effect pretty much every part of my body. In April, I saw a   and the running diagnosis as other things are ruled out was fibromyalgia. Blood test and x rays ruled out RA as well as something else that I don't remember the name of and showed that I had low vitamin D (14 ng mL).  My Dr started me on nortriptyline (10 mg) and told me to get a vitamin D supplement (5,000 iu). My ANA, however, came back positive. The value was 1 640 and the ANA pattern was described as \"nuclear course speckled\". This concerned me, as I do have a family history of lupus, several family members on both sides of my family, the closest related being my great aunt, another one more distantly related who died because of kidney problems related to lupus. Right before my follow up in June, I had another vitamin D test and it was just barely bellow the normal range (19 ng mL). At this point, she prescribed a 50,000iu vitamin D supplement to try to get my vitamin D well within that normal range. I mentioned the ANA at the appointment, but she did not seem concerned about the positive ANA and said it would be something to revisit if my pain persists without improvement. If anything, my pain has gotten worse since then. I did also add two new prescriptions from my psychiatrist (sertraline 75 mg and Adderall XR 10 mg) since then, but that is the only real change I've made. In addition to the family history, I do have what seem to be lupus symptoms, joint pain and swelling, fatigue, fingers and toes turn white when exposed to cold (and are generally more sensitive to being cold), difficulty breathing chest pain (although I do have asthma, so this could be attributed to that), mild hair loss (not enough for bald patches, but enough I'm surprised I don't have any), sunlight sensitivity (no butterfly rash, but my skin does get red very easily and I feel significantly worse if I spend too much time out in the sun), and potentially more that I'm just not thinking of. Obviously I don't want to have lupus, but with all of these factors, I'm worried about it, especially with my pain worsening. My next appointment isn't until September. And by then and then the time it takes me to get into a rheumatologist I imagine it'll be the end of the year or early next year by the time I'll get to see someone. I'm already so tired of missing out on life because of my pain and fatigue and I can't help but think of everything I'll continue to miss out on in that time and the worry of less noticible symptoms worsening while I wait. Would it be worth it to go see a rheumatologist without waiting for a potential referral to my  ?

This is a list of symptoms and my plan for diagnosis treatment of possible Intracranial Hypertension. If there is anything I should know consider that I have not included, please inform me. \nThe visual symptoms began 3 days ago, when I was 5 days into my course of Doxycycline 100 mg, which I was taking twice a day beginning July 26 2021. When I started the course, I noticed slight head pressure but dismissed it as a common headache. On the day of the visual symptoms, upon waking I first noticed a dark floater following my line of sight. I next noticed that my vision was out of focus and blurry, like moving objects have an afterimage. I am also sensitive to light and have become slightly nearsighted. I also noticed head pressure that would remain present and increase in intensity throughout the day, as well as an ache behind the eyes. I also experience some ear ringing pressure. I stopped the antibiotic that day. \nAll of these eye symptoms, including the headache pressure eyeache, are still present to this moment. I know that Doxycycline can cause Intracranial Hypertension, but in some cases the symptoms go away after stopping the antibiotic. I have yet to hear of this ever being the case, and I am very worried about irreversible eye damage that could become even worse. \nI have contacted my primary care physician who referred me to an optometrist. The optometrist does not think I am an emergency and plans to contact me at least next week. From my reading, I know that I should firstly be seen by an ophthalmologist   neuro opthalmologist to examine my retinas for papilloedema. I also know that I should see a neurologist, and have my head scanned. Lastly (to my knowledge) I should get a lumbar puncture to assess the opening pressure of my intracranial fluid. If IH is confirmed, I will be either put on medication or, if the case is serious, be given a lumbar shunt to mediate the flow of intracranial fluid. As I am in the early stages and my vision is not yet severely affected, I am hoping either discontinuing the medication alone or medication will prevent further eye damage. \nMy main concern at the moment is how much time I have before I could possibly lose more vision.

This lasted for just under a week, but have since gone away, and I have no head or neck pain or strain anymore.\nWhat's scaring the fuck out of me is today a spot on my upper left back staryed to go like, all I can describe it as is \"half numb\", not fully numb, but not fully feeling. If i scratched the area it might not hurt nearly as bad as other unaffected areas but will still hurt.\nIt's not debilitating or limiting, but it's a weird feeling that's freaking me out. A few times it started getting quite warm and the sensation spread to a other patches of skin of my back, it's been there for a few hours now, as it happened earlier today, and I'm just very scared.\nI also started getting sone aches in certain parts if my back. They're stopped now\nIt's a quite subtle feeling but it's there and it's weird.\nI'm horrified, do you think this might be a brain tumor?\nI'm really scared, my nerves are shot from the worries and anxiety and now this is another thing to he worried about, I actually felt a good bit better today, and felt quite well, then this happened  (..thank you.\nEdit  I should add that I've been bending over a lot lately and doing various exercises I'm not used to, and about a week or 2 ago I moved a heavy quilt that was soaking wet, it was in a bag and i moved it mostly with one arm and it was heavy af.","label":[[18,25,"DISEASE"],[281,288,"DISEASE"],[2137,2144,"DISEASE"]]}

I've had low B12 before when I first felt fatigued (not a sudden decline like this time) where I had 3 injections over the year (2018) and felt the best I ever felt. I took oral supplements following that for about 2 years.\nI had all my bloods done again and again, cholesterol, thyroid, celiac, a bunch of random diseases. Nothing really showed up. A chronic fatigue specialist found I had MTHFR mutations that he thinks may cause me an inability to absorb B12 orally so I went back on injections.

It is hard, about 2 3cm (hard to tell through the chest muscle and skin, and is not strongly attached to any particular location. It is not painful, does not cause any discoloration, and the only issue I have is that it makes being topless mildly awkward as it sticks out a bit. I visited a GP a few years back but he did not believe that there was anything dangerous about it and did not prescribe any medication or suggest any procedures.\nI originally assumed it was gyno, but I do not have any of the common risk factors for it such as steriod use, puberty, old age, or obesity. It also is only on one side and has not gone away with time. I also was suggested to look into fat necrosis, damaged tissue, or similar. This would be a reasonably likely cause as I have been hit in the chest thousands of times during fencing. But I believe that I had it earlier than that. Or it could just be a random deformity. Cancer is almost entirely ruled out as I have none of the risk factors and the growth time seems wrong as well as I have had no symptoms of cancer.

I was put on Paxil around 6, which helped for a short time but ended with me having suicidal thoughts at 8 years old and being on the maximum dose they could give a person. The early 2000's were a hell of a time. I hadn't been on meds again until this year. My anxiety is  severe,  I'm somewhat agoraphobic because I don't want to have panic attacks in public, and my life has been very stunted by my anxiety and depression.\nI've been to therapy and that helped somewhat, but I plateaued with him and then COVID hit. I couldn't afford therapy anymore. I did get properly diagnosed with ADHD (along with a math learning disorder, GAD and panic disorder, and depression with recurrent episodes) in January. A lot of my school struggles made more sense. I couldn't be diagnosed with PTSD because my symptoms are spread across different events, so she couldn't technically give me that, but she recommended I get therapy for trauma. My anxiety has gotten worse and worse since the pandemic started, and I've lost all the progress I made. That's what pushed me to try medication to help me start rebuilding the progress I made and I'm finding sliding scale therapy to do in combo.\nI've been on Lexapro for about 6 weeks or so, and it's done nothing. My depression has gotten worse, anxiety is no different. I have sleeping issues now, vivid nightmares and waking up a lot then being exhausted all day. At 10mg my gastrointestinal system was getting destroyed and I really wasn't sleeping, so I've been on 5mg for about 4 weeks and this is where I currently am. Doctor is referring me to a psychiatrist to make a more educated choice on meds, she brought up a bunch of meds we could try and different drug classes (I'm informed on some like SSRI and SNRI but only in how they function) but I was lost on a lot of it and don't know what the best course will be.

Baby seems fine but I am worried it may affect her? Please help !!","label":[[161,168,"DISEASE"],[187,190,"DISEASE"],[202,207,"DISEASE"],[243,250,"DISEASE"]]}
{"text":"One minute its appendicitis, next minute its not   what could it be? On Tuesday evening after dinner, my partner\n  24m\n  131 pounds\n  5ft 8in\n  White British\n  Asthma and migraine sufferer\n  5  year history of stomach issues which have never been diagnosed as anything despite numerous colonoscopies\n  Current bad stomach pain for 3 days\n  Takes Ventolin for asthma as required\n  Does not smoke or take recreational drugs \n  Drinks small amounts of alcohol occasionally\nstarted experiencing stomach pain and nausea quite suddenly. A few hours later he was violently vomiting up his entire stomach contents, writhing around in agony and having bad diarrhoea. I took him to A E who took blood and said his white blood cell count was a bit raised and that it was probably food poisoning.\nWe went home, however the next day he woke up and the stomach pain had worsened and had mainly travelled to the right side of his abdomen. He had completely lost his appetite and the pain was worse upon moving and walking. \nWe went to the GP who did a physical examination and said he thinks it might be appendicitis and to go back to A E.\nWe were in A E for seven hours yesterday and eventually admitted him to the pre surgery assessment unit. He saw a surgeon who did another physical examination but concluded that he cant have appendicitis as hes not in enough pain on the right hand side  despite being on morphine which isnt having much effect on the pain. They suggested it could be infectious colitis instead. Apparently his blood tests have slightly improved since the initial test on Tuesday.\nMy question is, what could this be, and could it still be appendicitis?\nThey havent scanned him yet, plus he had a colonoscopy about a month ago which was normal.\nThank you Im advance, Im worried.","label":[[160,166,"DISEASE"],[171,179,"DISEASE"],[359,365,"DISEASE"],[1486,1493,"DISEASE"]]}

Not insured and relatively healthy. When I go to the   I use the clinic and its solved quickly. I have had a chronic pain in my left shoulder area. I would say this has been going on for 5 6 years now and pretty constant. Definitely 2 times a month if not more. It is pretty severe to where its all I can think about when it hurts. Its always in the same area. Starts at top inside of scapula under the clavicle but will some times travel down into the entire scapula. I have a habit of putting pressure on it when it hurts. Then it will go away I believe it might be stress induced? But sometimes it hurts even when I am not stressed at all. I have iced it I work out , I move a lot, I had a professional tell me stretches to include in my routine and  that is where I got a pressure point tool I use when it hurts bad. Recently about 2 weeks ago the outside under my armpit started to hurt where I didnt want to lay on it or anything and when I did there was pain. That has gone away now and now it is cracking so loudly if I move it and the chronic pain is slightly there so when I do pull it across my body or up and its a crack and popping sensation and it can happen multiple times in a row. \n  I am not sure if this is relative but there is a pain almost like a bruise in my radius on the same arm now.

{"text":"M30 Likelihood I had COVID before first confirmed US case? I'm wondering if anyone with medical knowledge can tell if I probably had COVID. The reason I ask is because of the timing. I first developed a cough Jan 10, 2020, a Friday, which I believed to have been caused because I had accidently kicked the blanket off myself while I was asleep and woke up with my body very cold. But I continued to work that day because I only started coughing when I was already at the office but felt alright. By the weekend I had developed an extremely painful sore throat, causing me agony when I coughed or sneezed. I had also lost a lot of energy (to the point I was active for about 6 hours of the day, only about an hour at a time before needing a nap) and had developed a high fever, I also went from eating normal to having instant noodle soup and than to nothing at all. I went to see a Doctor on Monday Jan 13th 2020, my temperature was 103 a throat swab had tested positive for strep throat, which the Doctor said was becoming serious. I was issued strong IBUProfen and antibiotics which immediately made my throat feel better and I regained a good deal of energy.\nHowever by Tuesday when continuing the medication which said take with food and I had not eaten for a few days and I was getting nauseous. I attributed the nausea to the pills I was taking without food so I bought a Jack in the Box munchie meal and found the taste radically changed, it all tasted like cardboard or like I was eating the napkins. I also found the taste of my favorite drink, Diet Coke to become very bitter and could not drink it anymore.  I could only tolerate sweet things like apple juice, root beer or Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwiches. Even Orange Juice was giving my stomach problems because of the acidity. I initially thought the pills was responsible for the taste change, since the details of COVID were mostly unavailable at the time.\nMy fever broke that day (Tuesday) but I kept coughing and I generally felt unwell for the rest of the week, slightly getting worse over time and getting better by the weekend. I wouldn't say I had trouble breathing, but breathing heavily would cause me to cough and without painkillers (or when their effects were wearing off), coughing would lead to agony so I subconsciously tried to breath normally.  I did have some brain fog after the fever broke, with trouble focusing.  According to the internet, coughing was not a symptom of strep throat and instead pointed towards a viral infection. However I was around my father a lot, he never got sick and he later took a test months later showing he never had COVID.  Admittedly my cough was never serious, I was just uncontrollably having medium coughs.\nThe reason I detail these events is because the first confirmed COVID case in the US was on Jan 20, 2020, 10 days after I started getting sick. I figured the odds of me having COVID would have been remote given it happened before the first case, but in hindsight I realize the US might not known how to look for COVID yet. The first confirmed case guy person had been to Wuhan, I had not nor had I traveled out of the US in some months. I did have a lot of contact with some Chinese clients coming into the California health insurance office where I worked weekday, but whether or not they'd been to Wuhan, I wouldn't know. I had seen a Doctor who confirmed a strep throat infection but I have no idea if they were even looking for COVID at that point in the pandemic. Was it likely I had COVID? Or did I just have strep throat and a viral infection of some sort?  \nThe reason I've become suspicious is because of the symptom I had of my taste changing, something that I think is possibly unique to COVID.  It had really perturbed me at the time because I had never experienced anything like it before.  But I have little medical knowledge on the topic and I'm interested in understanding more.","label":[[21,26,"DISEASE"],[133,138,"DISEASE"],[975,980,"DISEASE"],[1053,1062,"DRUG"],[1067,1078,"DRUG"],[1883,1888,"DISEASE"],[2200,2211,"DRUG"],[2460,2465,"DISEASE"],[2503,2518,"DISEASE"],[2635,2640,"DISEASE"],[2794,2799,"DISEASE"],[2906,2911,"DISEASE"],[3042,3047,"DISEASE"],[3390,3395,"DISEASE"],[3462,3467,"DISEASE"],[3519,3524,"DISEASE"],[3545,3550,"DISEASE"],[3564,3579,"DISEASE"],[3729,3734,"DISEASE"]]}
{"text":"Consistent stomach pain and vomiting happening every month for 1 year now and none of the docs seem to find the cause solution. Hi everyone, I  24M  have been getting almost monthly stomach pain followed by vomiting for the past year now. I have talked with GPs and did multiple blood tests and ultra sound as well. I really can't pinpoint any specific food causing the problem as it happens purely random irrespective of the food I had before the pain occurs. This is getting really serious for me as there is no way of preventing it and not knowing what to do next when your stomach feels like being stabbed and vomiting occurs consistently is pretty daunting. It normally goes away within 2 3 days but again comes back after almost a month or so. Its almost like periods for me and I literally wait for the next time for it to happen and it'll happen few days earlier or later than expected.
