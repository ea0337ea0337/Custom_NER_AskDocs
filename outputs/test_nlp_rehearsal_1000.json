An extraordinary Thursday began with Mitt Romney proclaiming \"Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud\" - though he stopped short of joining the growing #NeverTrump movement among Republicans. Hours later, the Republican debate turned into a literal penis-measuring contest, as opposed to the metaphorical ones of previous debates. \"I guarantee you there is no problem,\" said Trump. Perhaps if we allowed them to actually bring out tape measures they wouldn't have to establish their macho credentials through posturing promises of carpet bombing, deportation and torture. But the most extraordinary moment came at the end. After attacking Trump as a fraud and a danger to the country, when asked if they'd support him as nominee all three of the other candidates said, in effect, Yeah, sure, no problem. So much for putting country ahead of party, but apparently one's sense of responsibility is unrelated to hand size.","label":[[16,25,"DATE"],[99,109,"NORP"],[152,160,"DATE"],[172,183,"PERSON"],[197,209,"PERSON"],[281,291,"ORG"],[307,318,"NORP"],[320,325,"TIME"],[337,347,"NORP"],[767,772,"ORG"],[861,866,"CARDINAL"]]}
